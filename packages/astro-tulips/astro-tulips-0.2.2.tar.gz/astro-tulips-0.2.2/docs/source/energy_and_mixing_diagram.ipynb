    "In this notebook we will discuss how to create one of the possible `tulips` diagrams. The energy and mixing diagrams gives an overview about the energy generation rates thoughout a the stellar model. Moreover, it provides information about the mixing processes occuring in the interior. In this diagram, `tulips` visualizes the stellar model as a circle, where its radius represents the total mass of the star. \n",

    "The stellar model is shown as a circle, whose radius represents the total mass (however, this can be changed by modifying the `raxis` property). The colors inside the star represents the energy generation rate. As indicated by the colorbar on the right, yellow to red colors are used for a positive energy generation rate, caused by nuclear burning processes. As we can see in the inset HR diagram, we are looking at a star in the later stages of its evolution. We can observe burning in a shell, as well as a burning region in its core. The colors can also show energy loss by neutrino emission, which are shown in purple. You can hide the colorbar by setting `show_colorbar` to `False`. It is possible to put limits on the burning rates using the `cmin` and `cmax` property. In the example above we used the default values. However, if you are for example only interested in energy generation and not in cooling, you could change `cmin` to 0 to only include positive energy generation rates. "
