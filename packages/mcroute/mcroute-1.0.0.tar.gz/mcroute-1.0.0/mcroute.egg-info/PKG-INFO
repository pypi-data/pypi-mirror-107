Description: # MCRoute
        Markov chain modelling of transportation networks.
        
        This package enables the modelling of networks (transportation or otherwise) in
        which movement through the network is represented by discrete state Markov
        chains.
        
        MCRoute extends the [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/index.html)
        module, requiring each node and edge to have an accompanying transition
        probability matrix that can be used during network traversal calculations. The
        package also incldues utility functions for constructing transition matrices
        from data and theoretical distributions.
