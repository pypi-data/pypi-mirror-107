Description: 
        # dis-cover
        Disassemble binaries and recover as much info as possible
        
        ## How to use
        
        ### Run the case studies
        
        To run the case studies, simply `make run-scenarios`. You need to have `docker` installed.
        
        ### Command-line
        
        You can install dis-cover by running `pip install dis-cover`.
        
        Here are the CLI options :
        
        ```
        $ dis-cover --help
        usage: dis-cover [-h] [-o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] [-p] [-b | -c] file
        
        Disasemble binaries and recover as much info as possible
        
        positional arguments:
          file                  File to dis-cover
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -o OUTPUT_DIRECTORY, --output-directory OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
                                Directory where the temporary files are written
          -p, --pickle          Output info in the pickle format (used with --bin)
          -b, --bin             Extract info from a binary file (default)
          -c, --cpp             Compile C++ file under multiple scenarios and extract info from the given outputs
        ```
        
        `dis-cover` is in early development, it will probably not work yet on your own binaries.
