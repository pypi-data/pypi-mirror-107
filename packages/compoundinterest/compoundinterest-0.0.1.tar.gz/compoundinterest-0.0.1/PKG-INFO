Description: # **COMPOUND INTEREST FACTORS**
        This is a module of compound interest factors which includes single payment, uniform payment series, and arithmetic gradient calculations
        ### **By Zaafirrahman**
        
        ## **Installation**
        
        This library can be installed by the pip command, open your terminal and type in the following command...
        
        ```python
        pip install compoundinterest
        ```
        
        ## **Functions of this library**
        
        First import the library using this command 
        ```python
        import compoundinterest as ci
        ```
         and then proceed to call the functions
        
        ## Single Payment
        
        ## `ci.fp()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of future value based on present value
        
        ## `ci.pf()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on future value
        
        
        ## Uniform Payment Series
        
        ## `ci.fa()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of future value based on annual value
        
        ## `ci.af()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on future value
        
        ## `ci.pa()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on annual value
        
        ## `ci.ap()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on present value
        
        
        ## Arithmetic Gradient
        
        ## `ci.pg()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of present value based on gradient value
        
        ## `ci.ag()`
        
        This function can be used to calculate compound interest factor of annual value based on gradient value
        
        
        ## **The parameters**
        
        **i (interest rate)** - Interest rate (without percent) used in the calculation
        
        **n (time period)** - Investment time period (in year/s) used in the calculation
        
        ### **Example :**
        
        You are saving $ 30,000 USD in the bank at an interest rate of 10% annually. How much will it be worth when you take it in 5 years?
        
        In this case, the variables that you already know are present value ($ 30,000 USD), interest rate (10%), and investment period (5 years). Whereas the variable that you are looking for is the future value. So you will need the `ci.fp()` function with the following calculations:
        
        ```python
        >>> import compoundinterest as ci
        >>> ci.fp(10,5)*30000
        
        48315.30000000002
        ```
        
        So, your money in the next 5 years is $ 48,315.3 USD
