Jembe Web Framework
===================

Python Web Framework for builiding modern web applications, runs on top of Flask, designed with following goals:

- App is build using custom, reusable, reactive, responsive UI components;
- Developers can stay focused on "business" logic and write UI logic only for very specific use cases;
- UI Component is created by extending Python class, with simple API, and writing associated Jinja2 template; 
- Complex UI interactions can be created without or with minimal use of javascript code;
- There should be no reason to think off, consider or implement logic for:
    - Handling http request-response cycle
    - Routing
    - Handling any "low level" web/http api
