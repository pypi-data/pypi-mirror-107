# Music-bot
Greeting! Welcome to my miraculous bot repository!
Here's how to setup!
# Setup process
1. If you gonna host on your pc edit last line to be bot.run("token"). If you're gonna host on  repl add .env file and add TO=token. If you're gonna to host with heroku I have file ready for you just edit config var to be KEY TO VALUE bot token
2. Then fire it up it should show your bot name id and stuff
Default prefix is "m." you can change at bot variable
