# Gesundheit pÃ«r tutti

This project consists in a chatbot that aims to help people that may have some limits to access information about services related to health in South Tyrol, such as medical services, available doctors and open pharmacies. The program accepts text, audio and image input in different languages. The user will get the results as on-screen text or audio according to his/her input and language choice.

Since the aim of this project is to improve accessibility, this chatbot can be easily used by immmigrants, teenagers, elderly people or phisically challenged people.

Here you can find image and audio files to try out different kind of input: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xHndS1OlaZyqfxz1ytqpy08N0-mK0onh?usp=sharing
