# Galaxykit

Galaxykit is a client library for [galaxy\_ng](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/science/pasta-3d-flat.html), designed for use in internal testing.

It's intended to be a low-dependency and low-abstraction client for performing actions on a remote Automation Hub or galaxy\_ng instance.
