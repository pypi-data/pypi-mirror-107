# Django Cloud Deployer

This package facilitates hybrid cloud deployment (IaaS/PaaS and FaaS) of Django web applications. By annotating project urls with the plugin's wrapper functions, a developer can indicate in which cloud deployment model each url resource should be executed.

## Requirements

To use this package, you will need the following Software tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Serverless Framework CLI](https://www.serverless.com/)

You will also need the CLI tools of the cloud providers you will be using:

- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)

## Setup

First, install the package:

```
pip install django-cloud-deployer
```

Then, make sure to add the package (and its requirements) to your project's requirements file:

```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The package features two functions, `runInPaaS` and `runInFaaS`, that may be used to indicate in which cloud deployment model (PaaS or FaaS, respectively) a url resource should be executed.

Example:

```python
# urls.py

from django.urls import include, path
from django_cloud_deployer import runInPaaS, runInFaaS
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    runInPaaS(path('faq/', views.faq, name='faq')),
    runInPaaS(path('polls/', include('polls.urls'))),
    runInFaaS(path('auth/', include('auth.urls'))),
]
```

Note that, by default, url resources with run in FaaS.

## CLI tool

The package may be used as a CLI tool:

```
$ python -m django_cloud_deployer

Usage: django_cloud_deployer <operation> 

Available operations:
- deploy 
- check_deploy
- destroy 
```

### Check Deploy

The `check_deploy` command allows the developer to observe, based on the annotated urls, where each resource will be deployed and executed.

Usage:

```
$ python -m django_cloud_deployer check_deploy
```


Example:

```
$ python -m django_cloud_deployer check_deploy

Please enter the name of the Django settings module (e.g., 'mysite.settings'):
> mysite.settings

The following urls will run in the FaaS provider:
^/?$
^auth/login/?$
^auth/logout/?$

The following urls will run in the PaaS provider:
^polls/?$
^polls/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/?$
^polls/(?P<pk>[0-9]+)/results/?$
^polls/(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)/vote/?$
```

### Deploy

The `deploy` command allows the developer to deploy the django project, based on the annotated urls.

Usage:

```
$ python -m django_cloud_deployer deploy <paas provider> <faas provider>

Available PaaS providers:
- heroku
Available FaaS providers:
- azure
```

Note that you will need to be logged in to the chosen PaaS and FaaS providers CLIs. If you are not, you will be asked to login first.

After the deployment is completed, a `django_cloud_deployer.json` configuration file will be produced:

```json
{
        "projectName": "...",
        "paasConfig": {
            "provider": "...",
            "resource": "...",
            "url": "..."
        },
        "faasConfig": {
            "provider": "...",
            "resource": "...",
            "url": "..."
        }
}
```

### Destroy

The `destroy` command allows the developer to delete all the infrastructure resources created with the deployment of the Django project.

Usage:

```
$ python -m django_cloud_deployer destroy
```
