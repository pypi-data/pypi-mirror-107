        **What is this project all about?**
        
        This project is all about:-
        
        1.  Detecting Human Poses with Machine Learning
        2.  Building AI based Personal Exercise Trainer for specific exercise
        3.  Running exercise based on specific time slot as user input
        
        **Why is this project important?**
        
        1.  You can define how computers can detect Human Movement with the webcam.
        2.  How computer processes the real-time data and predicts the possibilities
        3.  How computers can play a crucial role in improving someone's health
        
        **What is that you will learn from this project?**
        
        1.  You will learn the fundamental concepts of programming in python like basic syntax
        2.  You will understand how variables work in python
        3.  You will be able to define list data type in python and how list indexing works
        4.  You will learn how to call a specific function from the module and use it in your code
        5.  You will learn how basic loops work in python
        6.  You will learn about identifiers or keywords in python and how to use them in code
        7.  You will be able to build your own if-else logic in python
        8.  Last but not the least you will learn about operators in python 
        
        **What is that you will be able to do after completing this project?**
        
        1.  You will be able to define how algorithms can make your computer do amazing stuff
        2.  You will be able to add your own exercises to your code
        3.  You will learn how to enhance your existing code and add features like email notification after the user is done with exercise and much more.
