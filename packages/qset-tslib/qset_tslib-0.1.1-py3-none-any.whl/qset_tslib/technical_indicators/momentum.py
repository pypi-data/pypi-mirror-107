    From: http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:williams_r
    Developed by Larry Williams, Williams %R is a momentum indicator that is the inverse of the
    Fast Stochastic Oscillator. Also referred to as %R, Williams %R reflects the level of the close
    relative to the highest high for the look-back period. In contrast, the Stochastic Oscillator
    reflects the level of the close relative to the lowest low. %R corrects for the inversion by
    multiplying the raw value by -100. As a result, the Fast Stochastic Oscillator and Williams %R
    produce the exact same lines, only the scaling is different. Williams %R oscillates from 0 to -100.
    Readings from 0 to -20 are considered overbought. Readings from -80 to -100 are considered oversold.
    Unsurprisingly, signals derived from the Stochastic Oscillator are also applicable to Williams %R.
    %R = (Highest High - Close)/(Highest High - Lowest Low) * -100
    Lowest Low = lowest low for the look-back period
    Highest High = highest high for the look-back period
    %R is multiplied by -100 correct the inversion and move the decimal.
    From: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/williamsr.asp
    The Williams %R oscillates from 0 to -100. When the indicator produces readings from 0 to -20, this indicates
    overbought market conditions. When readings are -80 to -100, it indicates oversold market conditions.
