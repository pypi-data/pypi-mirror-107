Testing different storages and spaces for spiral 3d on ALUCube. No p or h
adaptivity used. In the first tests the DG terms are present so the
DiagNbStencil will be used.

Using a hp-lagrangr space, the memory usage is between 6.4G with petsc
and >11GB with istl on a grid with only 1728 elements (100k dofs).
Using a hp-dglegendre space reduces the memory usage considerably (1.5GB
with petsc and 3GB with istl) - although the number of dofs is now 200k).

Removing the DG terms (i.e. using the DiagStencil only) still leads to
memory usage of more then 1.5G with petsc (twice that with istl) which
seems a lot for a small grid like this. Switching to the non hp lagrange
space leads to the same results as expected,

All the tests are with only jacobi preconder - using something like
amg/hyper will lead to a significant increase in memory usage (had 20GB
with my first twophaseflow test...).

It seems like using a matrix even on this small grid is not possible.

What I don't understand is why the lagrange space has a significantly higher
memory usage although it has fewer dofs and it should have a smaller
connectivity.

For Lagrange we are not using that
(a) only few basis functions have non zero traces on faces/edges so the
    DiagNBStencil could be taken smaller.
(b) the DG terms are only active in the case of non-conforming hp
    faces/edges and otherwise they are zero - but this is difficult to
    figure out.

It seems like 3d simulations with higher order p are out of the
question....
