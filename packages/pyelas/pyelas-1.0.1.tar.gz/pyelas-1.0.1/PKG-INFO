Description: 
        This package is the port to Python of libelas.
        
        It is a library for computing disparity maps of large images.
        It was written by Andreas Geiger as a C++ library and MATLAB toolbox.
        I wrote only the Python interface to use it in Python scripts.
        
        You can find the paper where the algorithm is described at
