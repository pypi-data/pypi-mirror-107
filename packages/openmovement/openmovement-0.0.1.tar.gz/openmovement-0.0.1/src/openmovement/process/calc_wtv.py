    Calculate the Wear-Time Validation (30-minute epochs) for a given sample ndarray [[time_seconds, accel_x, accel_y, accel_z]].

    Based on the method by van Hees et al in PLos ONE 2011 6(7), 
      "Estimation of Daily Energy Expenditure in Pregnant and Non-Pregnant Women Using a Wrist-Worn Tri-Axial Accelerometer".
    
    Accelerometer non-wear time is estimated from the standard deviation and range of each accelerometer axis, 
    calculated for consecutive blocks of 30 minutes.
    A block was classified as non-wear time if the standard deviation was less than 3.0 mg 
    (1 mg = 0.00981 m*s-2) for at least two out of the three axes,
    or if the value range, for at least two out of three axes, was less than 50 mg.

    :returns: ndarray of [time,worn], where worn is 0 (not worn), or 1 (worn)
