    """
    Handles a "potentially zipped" file where a file is needed on (local) disk, and can't just be a stream from a compressed file 
    -- e.g. memory-mapped files or external processes.
    If the file extension is not '.zip', the original file is passed through via 'with' syntax.
    Otherwise, the file is expected to be a .ZIP archive, and the 'filter' is used to find a matching inner filename.  
    It is an error if there is not exactly one matching inner filename.
    The matching file is extracted to a temporary location, and that location is passed through the 'with' syntax.
    At the end of the 'with' block, the temporary file is deleted.
