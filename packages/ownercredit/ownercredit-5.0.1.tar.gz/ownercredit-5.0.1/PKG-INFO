Description: Purpose: to implement currencies where every unit is backed by wealth, and where
        every holder of wealth may create credit.  The system implements a limit, K, on
        the amount of credit created relative to pledged wealth, to control inflation
        and deflation, automatically ensuring that the value of each unit of credit
        remains roughly constant in terms of some "reference" basket of wealth.
