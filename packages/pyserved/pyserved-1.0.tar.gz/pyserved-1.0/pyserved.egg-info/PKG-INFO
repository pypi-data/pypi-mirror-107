        ## Info
        
        This package is used to send files over a network server using sockets. The maximum size of file is 100 mbs.
        
        ## How does it work?
        
        So this package comes with 2 cli commands pyserved and pyserved-c. The "pyserved" command is for starting up the server which will run on the reciever's server and pyserved-c is for the client to send the file to the server.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        $ pip install pyserved
        ```
        
        ## Guide
        
        So you must have 2 computers to do this , and one sample file to transfer between the computers.
        
        ### Server
        
        So in 1 computer you must run this command to start the server
        
        ```
        $ pyserved
        ```
        
        and by executing this command you will get the following results:
        
        ```
        $ pyserved
        ______________________________________________________
        
        You can find out the ip address by typing
        
         $ ifconfig en1
        
         or
        
         $ ifconfig en0
        
         or you can search google for it.
        
        
        Server HOST on which you want to run:
        PORT:
        ```
        
        After filling out the server host and port you will see the following:
        
        ```
        $ pyserved
        ______________________________________________________
        
        You can find out the ip address by typing
        
         $ ifconfig en1
        
         or
        
         $ ifconfig en0
        
         or you can search google for it.
        
        
        Server HOST on which you want to run: 192.168.1.20
        PORT: 8089
        ______________________________________________________
        [STARTING] SERVER is starting on 192.168.1.20:8089
        [RUNNING] Server is succesfully running....
        [RUNNING] The files which will be sent to you will be saved on /Users/{user}/pyserved directory.
        
        ```
        
        So when you run this command the server will start the files which will be sent to you will be saved on /Users/{user}/pyserved directory.
        
        ### Client
        
        While the server is running go on to the another computer and execute <s>order 66</s> this command:
        
        ```
        $ pyserved-c
        ```
        
        you will see this:
        
        ```
        $ pyserved-c
        
        ______________________________________________________
        
        Pyserved CLI Client
        
        Enter the host and port in the fields below.
        Server HOST:
        
        
        ```
        
        So enter the host and port on which the server is running on.
        
        ```
        $ pyserved-c
        ______________________________________________________
        
        Pyserved CLI Client
        
        Enter the host and port in the fields below.
        Server HOST: 192.168.1.20
        PORT: 8089
        Now enter the path of file which you want to send
        File path:
        ```
        
        Now it is asking for the path of the file which you want to send, so pick up any file which size is lower than 100mb and utf-8 encoded. (like .txt, .json, .py, .md, .ino, ipynb etc.)
        
        ```
        $ pyserved-c
        ______________________________________________________
        
        Pyserved CLI Client
        
        Enter the host and port in the fields below.
        Server HOST: 192.168.1.20
        PORT: 8089
        Now enter the path of file which you want to send
        File path:/Users/username/Desktop/opensource/anit/sockets/setup.py
        
        ______________________________________________________
        ```
        
        So after you enter the filepath go to the computer in which the server is running on and open Finder, go to /Users/username/pyserved, here you will see the copied file,initially with the name "copiedFileXXXX.filetype", if you open it will be the same file!
