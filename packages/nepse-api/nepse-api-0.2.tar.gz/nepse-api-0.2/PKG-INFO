Description: # NEPSE API Wrapper
        
        This python module fetches the data from [Nepali Stock Site](https://newweb.nepalstock.com/) and provides them in a pythonic
        and usable way.
        
        
        ## About
        
        This is a API wrapper for NEPSE API. This project was inspired from [PyPi Nepse](https://github.com/pyFrappe/nepse). 
        
        ## Why use this?
        
        How is this better than [PyPi Nepse](https://github.com/pyFrappe/nepse)?
        - It is asynchronous.
        - Data can be taken as attributes rather than from dict.
        - Data is fetched from the API rather than scraping the site.
        - Data is cached 
        
        ## APIs used
        
        The APIs that I used to create this API wrapper is:
        - https://newweb.nepalstock.com/api/nots/security/
        
        ## How to use?
        
        ```py
        import asyncio
        from nepse import Client
        
        async def main():
            # Initializes the client
            client = Client()
        
            # Gets the data
            data = await client.get_company(symbol="UPPER")
        
            # Prints the highest price for that company today
            print(data.daily_trade.high_price)
        
            # Properly closes the session
            await client.close()
            
        # Run the function
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        loop.run_until_complete(main())
        ```
