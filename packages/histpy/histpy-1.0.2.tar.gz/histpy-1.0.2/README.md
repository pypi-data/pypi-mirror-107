The histpy library provides a Histogram class which is, in essence, an array with axes attached defining the value of bin boundaries. It can handle an arbitrary number of dimensions, be accessed in a similar way as a numpy array, be projected, sliced, multiplied, fitted, plotted, etc. Itâ€™s loosely based on a ROOT histogram but using a more pythonic interface.
