# invest_tracker
A class that can be used to track investment

## Motivation

This package was a initiative to help me to have a better knowledge about my own investments.
The package is still in a initial development phase containing only a Asset class that can be used
to register and track informations and rentability about investments in investments funds.

## Usage

It uses investpy package to scrap investment funds historical data. For it to function correctly
the code of the asset must be provided when instantiating the class. The code can be obtained in
the investing.com site by locating the characters in parenthesis after the asset name.
