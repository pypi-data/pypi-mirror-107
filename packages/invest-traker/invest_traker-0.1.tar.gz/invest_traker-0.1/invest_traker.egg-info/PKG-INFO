Description: # invest_tracker
        A class that can be used to track investment
        
        ## Motivation
        
        This package was a initiative to help me to have a better knowledge about my own investments.
        The package is still in a initial development phase containing only a Asset class that can be used
        to register and track informations and rentability about investments in investments funds.
        
        ## Usage
        
        It uses investpy package to scrap investment funds historical data. For it to function correctly
        the code of the asset must be provided when instantiating the class. The code can be obtained in
        the investing.com site by locating the characters in parenthesis after the asset name.
