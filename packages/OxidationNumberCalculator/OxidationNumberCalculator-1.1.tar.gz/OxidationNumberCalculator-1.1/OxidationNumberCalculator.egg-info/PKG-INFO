Description: # Oxidation Number Calculator - Beta Version - (Still Needs Optimizing and Bug Removal):
        The oxidation number Calculator takes in a chemical equation or individual compound and returns the oxidation numbers of each element involved (in the case of a chemical equation, several lists of oxidation numbers
        for each compound will be returned). This module has yet to be fully optimized and cleaned of potential bugs; more testing is to come in the following week along with updates.
