        <!-- Collection definition:
                a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects. 
                A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
                retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
                the overall group of items.

         A bundle that contains MAVEN Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) calibrated Level 2 science data, as well as the raw count data from which they are derived, and 
         ancillary ephemeris data. The calibrated data are in physical units, and 
         include electron and ion spectra in the 4 look directions (2 look directions 
         for each sensor/file).
