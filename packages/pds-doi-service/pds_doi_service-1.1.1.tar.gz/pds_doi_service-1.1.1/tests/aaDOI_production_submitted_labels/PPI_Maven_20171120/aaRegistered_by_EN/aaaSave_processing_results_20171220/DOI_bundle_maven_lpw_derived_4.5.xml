        <!-- Collection definition:
                a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects. 
                A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
                retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
                the overall group of items.

        <description>
           A bundle that contains data which have been derived from other data products or 
           determined by fits to other data. These are science quality data produced by 
           the MAVEN Langmuir Probe and Waves (LPW) instrument. The data include densities, temperatures, and Poynting 
           flux. The data have been provided by the LPW team in CDF files.
