        <!-- Collection definition:
                a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects. 
                A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
                retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
                the overall group of items.

         A collection of vector magnetic field data acquired by the Fluxgate Magnetimeter instrument aboard the MAVEN spacecraft. The data are calibrated and provided in physical units (nT).  The time resolution depends on the telemetry rate available when the data were taken.  The data are expressed in Planetocentric coordinates.
