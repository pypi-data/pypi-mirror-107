            <description>;This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the Mars
                Orbit Insertion (MOI) phase of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
                mission. The radio observations were carried out using the MGS
                spacecraft and Earth-based receiving stations of the NASA Deep
                Space Network (DSN). The observations were designed to test the
                spacecraft radio system, the DSN ground system, and MGS
                operations procedures; to be used in generating high-resolution
                gravity field models of Mars; and for estimating density and
                structure of the Mars atmosphere. Of most interest are likely to
                be the Orbit Data File and Original Data Record files, in the ODF
                and ODR directories, respectively, which provided the raw input
                to gravity and atmospheric investigations. The MOI phase extended
                from September 1997 to March 1999. On orbits 203-266 and 343-571
                (approximately April and June-September 1998, respectively) the
                spacecraft periapsis was especially low giving the highest
                per-orbit sensitivity to gravity anomalies during the entire
                mission. Data were organized in approximately chronological order
                and delivered on a set of 159 CD volumes at the rate of 2-3
                CD's per week. Typical volume of a one-day ODF was 300-400
                kB. Typical volume of an ODR was 5-10 MB, and there could be
                multiple ODR's per day depending on DSN schedules and
            observing geometry.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
