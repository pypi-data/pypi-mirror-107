            <description>This data set contains over 21000 temperature-pressure profiles
                (TPS files) of the neutral atmosphere derived from Mars Global
                Surveyor (MGS) radio occultation data. The profiles were
                previously archived in the MGS-M-RSS-5-SDP-V1.0 data set along
                with other reduced data products from the MGS Radio Science Team
                (RST). Here they have been pulled from the original 38 volumes
                and reorganized in chronological order on a single volume. The
                profiles themselves have not been modified, and the labels have
                been edited only to conform with the requirements of the new data
                set. This set of profiles is accompanied by a single occultation
            summary file which lists key characteristics of each experiment.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
