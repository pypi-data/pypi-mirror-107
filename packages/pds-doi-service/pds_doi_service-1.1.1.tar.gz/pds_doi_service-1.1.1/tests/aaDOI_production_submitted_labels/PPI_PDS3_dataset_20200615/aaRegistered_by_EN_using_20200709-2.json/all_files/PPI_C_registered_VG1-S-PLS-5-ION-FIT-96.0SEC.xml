            <description>THIS DATA SET CONTAINS THE ION PARAMETERS IN THE PLS VOLTAGE
                RANGE (10-5950 EV/Q) WITH FORMAL 1 SIGMA ERRORS OBTAINED FROM
                VOYAGER 1 DATA AT SATURN BY FITTING THE MEASURED SPECTRA WITH
                ISOTROPIC MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTIONS TO OBTAIN PLASMA DENSITIES,
                TEMPERATURES, AND VELOCITY. ONLY SPECTRA WHICH HAD DISTINCT
                CURRENT PEAKS WERE FIT. SPECTRA WERE FIT USING ONE OR TWO ION
                SPECIES, PROTONS AND/OR A HEAVY ION WHICH WAS TAKEN TO BE OXYGEN.
                OUTSIDE L~10 ION SPECTRA CHANGE RAPIDLY, SO THE VALUES IN THIS
                DATA SET DO NOT REPRESENT AVERAGE PLASMA CONDITIONS IN THE OUTER
                MAGNETOSPHERE. THE VALUES FOR POSITION AND MAGNETIC FIELD GIVEN
                IN THE DATA SET ARE ONLY APPROXIMATE AND SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR
                PUBLICATION. PARAMETERS WHICH ARE IDENTICALLY 0 AND HAVE
                UNCERTAINTIES OF 0 WERE NOT FIT DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DATA
                DESCRIPTION OF THIS DATA SET IS GIVEN IN RICHARDSON (1986). DATA
                FORMAT: EACH DATA RECORD CONSISTS OF 5+2N LINES, WHERE N IS THE
                NUMBER OF IONS FIT. LINE 1: S (A1, INDICATES THE START OF A NEW
                FIT) HRMIN(I5),SEC.MSEC(F7.3) RADIUS(F7.3),RHO(F7.3) MODE OF
                FITTER(I4) THIS DATA SET, INDICATING PROGRAMS INCORPORATING THE
                FULL RESPONSE FUNCTION OF THE INSTRUMENT FOR L MODES DATA):
                CHI-SQUARE FROM FIT (E7.3) TELL WHICH CHANNELS WERE FIT: CUP
                IDENTIFIER (A,B,C,D) (A1) NUMBER OF SETS OF CHANNELS FIT (I3)
                CHANNEL OF EACH SET (2-20I3): LINE 6 F (LINE IDENTIFIER) (A1)
                MASS, CHARGE (I3,I2) WHERE THE X* VARIABLES ARE FORMAL 1 SIGMA
                UNCERTAINTIES: LINE 7 NUMBER (A1, I1) 6 AND 7 REPEAT ONCE FOR
                EACH ION SPECIES. A CYLINDRICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM CENTERED ON THE
                PLANET IS USED, WITH RHO OUTWARDS FROM THE SPIN AXIS, PHI IN THE
                DIRECTION OF ROTATION, AND Z THE DISTANCE ABOVE THE EQUATOR.
                V'S ARE VELOCITIES IN KM/S, W'S THERMAL SPEEDS IN KM/S,
                AND DENSITIES IN CM-3. VALUES OF B AND POSITION INFORMATION MAY
                BE UNRELIABLE AND SHOULD BE VERIFIED BEFORE USE. ADDITIONAL
                INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DATASET AND THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PRODUCED
                IT CAN BE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THIS CATALOG. AN OVERVIEW OF THE
                DATA IN THIS DATA SET CAN BE FOUND IN RICHARDSON (1986) AND A
            COMPLETE INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION CAN BE FOUND IN BRIDGE (1977).</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
