            <description>This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field
                intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum
                analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian magnetosphere.
                For each 4-second interval, a field strength is determined for
                each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center
                frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are
                logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.
                The time associated with each set of intensities (16 channels) is
                the time of the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where
                complete 4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the
                file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any
                other way. When one or more channels are missing within a scan,
                the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are edited but not
                calibrated. The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in
                raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they
                are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field
                strength. Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use
            with this data set described below.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
