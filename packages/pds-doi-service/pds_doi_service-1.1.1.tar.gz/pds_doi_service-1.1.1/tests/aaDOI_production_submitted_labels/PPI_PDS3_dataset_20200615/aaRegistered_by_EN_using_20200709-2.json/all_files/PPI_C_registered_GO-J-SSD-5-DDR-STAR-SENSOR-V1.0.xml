            <description>The Galileo star scanner is providing data on the instantaneous
                flux of 1.5 to 30 MeV electrons in the Jovian environment. It is
                able to measure fluxes of ~1 x 105 electrons cm-2 sec-1 or
                greater which generally means the data are usable inside of about
                12 and rarely as far out as 16.5 Jovian Radii (RJ). Typically,
                the data points are spaced about 400 or 80 seconds apart with
                infrequent periods of more rapid data depending upon the
                operational mode. It should be noted that data are generally
                accurate in time to only within 20 seconds without special
                processing. Pitch angle information generally cannot be extracted
                from this data set. Separate files exist for the Jovian insertion
                event (J0) and all subsequent perijove passes except J5 which
            occurred during a period of solar conjunction.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
