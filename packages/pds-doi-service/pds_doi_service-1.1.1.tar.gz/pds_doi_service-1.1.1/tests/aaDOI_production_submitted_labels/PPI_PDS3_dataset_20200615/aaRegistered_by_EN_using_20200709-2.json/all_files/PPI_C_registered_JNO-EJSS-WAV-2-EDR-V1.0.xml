            <description>The Juno Waves EDR complete data set includes all Waves science and
                housekeeping data for the entire Juno mission.  This data set consists
                of reformatted, uncalibrated, spectra and waveforms as well as unaltered
                housekeeping packets.  The reformatting operation re-assembles
                measurements which were too long to fit with in a single transmission
                unit to the Juno flight data system as well as decompressing data that
                were transmitted in compressed form.  The data for this set were
                acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR), High Frequency
                Receivers (HFR-44, HFR-45), as well as the Digital Signal Processor's
                housekeeping output.  This data set is intended to preserve the
                uncalibrated instrument packets and is to be used only as a last resort.
                Other Waves archived data sets are designed to be complete and more
                easily used.  Browse images associated with the other data sets provide
            a graphical search of the data included in this data set.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
