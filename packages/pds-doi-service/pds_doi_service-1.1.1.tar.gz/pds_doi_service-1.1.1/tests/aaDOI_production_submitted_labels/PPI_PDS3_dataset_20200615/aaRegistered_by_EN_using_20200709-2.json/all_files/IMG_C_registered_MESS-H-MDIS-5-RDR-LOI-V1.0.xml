            <description>Abstract
                ========
                The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide
                Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a
                common pivot platform. This dataset includes Map Projected Low-
                Incidence Angle Basemap RDRs (LOIs) which comprise a global map
                of I/F measured by the NAC or WAC filter 7 (both centered near
                750 nm) during the Extended Mission at low solar incidence
                angles to accentuate albedo and albedo variations, photometrically
                normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission
                angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees, at a spatial
                sampling of 256 pixels per degree. The LOI data set is a companion to
                the Basemap Data Record (BDR) data set, High Incidence Angle
                Illuminated from the East (HIE) data set, and High Incidence
                Angle Illuminated from the West (HIW) data set, all of which are
                also composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images, except acquired at
                higher solar incidence angles centered at 68 to 78 degrees to
                highlight topography.
                
                The map is divided into 54 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE,
                SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar
                quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile
                also contains 5 backplanes: observation ID; BDR metric, a metric used
                to determine the stacking order of component images, modified for the
                higher incidence angle centered near 78 degrees; solar incidence
            angle; emission angle; and phase angle.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
