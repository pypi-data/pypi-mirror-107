            <description>The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) raw complete data
                set includes all RPWS telemetry data for the entire Cassini
                mission.  This data set includes raw telemetry values for each
                frequency channel for each sensor for all times during the mission
                including the two Venus flybys, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter
                flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire Saturn tour.  Data
                for this data set are acquired from the RPWS Low Frequency
                Receiver (LFR), Medium Frequency Receiver (MFR), Medium Frequency
                Digital Receiver (MFDR) (which can be used to replace MFR band 2
                data), High Frequency Receiver (HFR), Sounder, and Langmuir Probe
                (LP).  Data are decompressed and internal receiver minipackets are
                unsegmented.  This data set is intended to preserve the telemetry
                data and is to be used only as a last resort.  Other RPWS archived
                data sets are designed to be complete and more easily used.
                Browse data sets associated with the other data sets provide a
                graphical search of the data included in this data set.  This data
                set should be the last used by a user of any of the RPWS archive
            as it is in the least user-friendly form.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
