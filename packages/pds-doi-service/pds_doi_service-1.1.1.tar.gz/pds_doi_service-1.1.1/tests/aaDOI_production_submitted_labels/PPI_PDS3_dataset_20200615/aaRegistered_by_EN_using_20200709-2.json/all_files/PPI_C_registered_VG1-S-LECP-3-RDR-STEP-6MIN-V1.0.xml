            <description>This far encounter step data set consists of the counting
                rate and flux data for electrons and ions from the Low Energy
                Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 1 while the
                spacecraft was within the vicinity of Saturn. This instrument
                measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles
                ( &gt;15 keV electrons and &gt;30 keV ions) with various levels of
                discrimination based on energy range and mass species. A subset
                of almost 100 LECP channels are included in this data set.
                The LECP data are globally calibrated to the extent possible.
                Particles include electrons, protons, alpha particles, and light,
                medium, and heavy nuclei particles.  The far encounter data are 6.4
                minute rate and flux measurements within 1/8 of the LECP
                instrumental motor rotation period (the angular scanning periods,
            or step period).</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
