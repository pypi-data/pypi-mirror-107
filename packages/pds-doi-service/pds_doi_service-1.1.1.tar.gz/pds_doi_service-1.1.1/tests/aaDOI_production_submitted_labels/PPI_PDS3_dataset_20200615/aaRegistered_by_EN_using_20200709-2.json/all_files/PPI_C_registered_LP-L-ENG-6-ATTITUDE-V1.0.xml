            <description>The Lunar Prospector attitude data set consists of values for the
                spacecraft spin rate and spin axis orientation (attitude) as a
                function of time. These values are determined from spacecraft
                attitude data (sun and limb crossing sensors) and ephemeris data.
                Spacecraft orientations are given as right ascension and
                declination of the spacecraft spin axis in the Mean-of-J2000
                Ecliptic reference frame. The attitude data set consists of a
                single, cumulative file for the entire mission. Records are added
                to this file following each significant change in either the spin
                rate or spin axis orientation. The spacecraft spin rates and
                attitudes in this data set are orbit averages. The instantaneous
                spin rate can be determined from the sun pulse data set. The
                instantaneous spin rate varies as the spacecraft passes into and
                out of the Moon's shadow and after each spacecraft maneuver.
                Generally, an attitude record is included for times immediately
            before and after each maneuver.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
