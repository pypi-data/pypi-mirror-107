            <description>The instrument has detected superthermal, energetic or fast ions
                whose energy exceeds 36 eV in the spacecraft frame of reference.
                These ions were observed in early orbits during measurements of
                the neutral density near periapsis, have an erratic and
                unpredictable signature, and occur at too high an altitude to be
                due to the neutral atmosphere. When the altitude of periapsis
                increased above the point where sensible neutral density
                measurements could be made, the instrument was configured
                specifically to detect superthermal ions. In general, for orbit
                numbers 1 to 645, data were taken from the RPA mode. The gas
                background signal with the filament on is about a factor of 10
                less in this mode than in non-RPA mode, resulting in a lower
                detection threshold. For orbit numbers above 923, the instrument
                was deliberately configured with the filament off and non-RPA
                mode data was used. For mass 16 the RPA voltage is about +3.8
            volts.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
