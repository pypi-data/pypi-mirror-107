            <description>The Electron Reflectometer Data Record (ERDR) is a time ordered
                series of electron measurements from the Mars Global Surveyor
                (MGS) Mission. Each record consists of a time tag with 19 scalar
                data points representing measurements of the electron flux in 19
                different energy channels, ranging from 10 eV to 20 keV, with an
                energy resolution of 25%. Each data point is a measure of the
                electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) averaged over a 360 x 14
                degree disk-shaped field of view (FOV). (Parts of this FOV are
                masked because of spacecraft obstructions, as described below.)
                During the Science Phasing Orbits (SPO), the spacecraft was in
                Array Normal Spin (ANS) configuration, for which the ER field of
                view sweeps out the entire sky (4-pi ster) every 50 minutes,
                which is much longer than the integration time per record (2 to
                48 sec, depending on energy and telemetry rate) and much longer
            than most timescales of interest in Mars' plasma environment.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
