            <description>This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the Mars
                Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) mission. The radio observations were
                carried out using the MRO spacecraft and Earth-based receiving
                stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The data set was
                designed primarily to support generation of high-resolution
                gravity field models for Mars and secondarily for estimating
                density and structure of the Mars atmosphere. Of most interest
                are likely to be the Orbit Data Files and Radio Science Receiver
                files in the ODF and RSR directories, respectively, which
                provided the raw input to gravity and atmospheric investigations,
                as well as the ionospheric and tropospheric media calibration
            files in the ION and TRO directories, respectively.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
