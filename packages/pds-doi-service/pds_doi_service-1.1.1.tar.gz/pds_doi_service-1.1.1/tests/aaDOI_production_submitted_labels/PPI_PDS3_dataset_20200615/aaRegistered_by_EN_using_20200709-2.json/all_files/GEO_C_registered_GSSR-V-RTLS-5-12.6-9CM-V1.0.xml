            <description>The Goldstone Solar System Radar observations of Venus from 1972
                until 1988 are included in this data set. The system operated at
                12.6 cm up until 1977 operated at 12.9 cm. The data consist of
                radar scaled backscatter cross sections in image format and, in
                most cases, associated altimetry observations. The data were
                acquired over 52 separate observing runs. In total the
                observations cover the region between approximately 260 degrees
                (leftmost) east longitude to 30 degrees (rightmost) east
                longitude, within approximately 20 degrees of the equator.
                Backscatter data were acquired with opposite sense circular
                polarization with incidence angles typically less than 10
                degrees. Associated altimetric data were acquired using a two or
                three station interferometric system. Data are presented in
                Mercator projection with degrees/pixel in longitude dependent on
            the individual data file.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
