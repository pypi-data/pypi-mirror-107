            <description>The Juno Waves calibrated full resolution survey data set includes all
                low rate science electric spectral densities from 50Hz to 41MHz and
                magnetic spectral densities from 50Hz to 20kHz with complete sweeps at
                30, 10 and 1 second intervals depending on the instrument mode.  This is
                a complete full resolution data set containing all low rate science data
                received from Waves from launch until the end of mission including
                initial checkout, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter orbits and all cruise
                data.
                
                Data are acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High
                Frequency Receiver (HFR) and are processed into spectra on board.
                These data are presented as ASCII text spreadsheets for ease of use.
                This data set is intended to be the most comprehensive and complete data
                set included in the Juno Waves archive.  Pre-rendered spectrograms
                generated from these data are included as well to lead the user to the
                particular data file(s) of interest.  This data set should be among the
                first used of any in the Waves archive as it will lead one to the
            information required to locate more detailed products.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
