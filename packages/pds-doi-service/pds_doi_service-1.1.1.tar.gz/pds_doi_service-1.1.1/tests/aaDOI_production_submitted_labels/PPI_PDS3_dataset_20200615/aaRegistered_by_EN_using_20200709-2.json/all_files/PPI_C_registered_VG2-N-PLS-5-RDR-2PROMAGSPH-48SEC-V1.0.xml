            <description>This data set gives the best available values for ion densities,
                temperatures, and velocities near Neptune derived from data
                obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment. All parameters are
                obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function
                of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a
                non-linear least squares fitting routine to find the plasma
                parameters which, when coupled with the full instrument response,
                best simulate the data. The PLS instrument measures
                energy/charge, so composition is not uniquely determined but can
                be deduced in some cases by the separation of the observed
                current peaks in energy (assuming the plasma is co-moving). In
                the upstream solar wind protons are fit to the M-long data since
                high energy resolution is needed to obtain accurate plasma
                parameters. In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low that several
                L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase the
                signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be
                reliably fit. These averaged spectra were fit using two proton
                maxwellians with the same velocity. The values given in the
                upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the
                density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and
                magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures
                are derived for each fit component. In the magnetosphere spectra
                do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity
                vectors, so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal. In some cases
                the azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid
                corotation is assumed. In the 'outer' magnetosphere
                (L&gt;5) two distinct current peaks appear in the spectra H+ and
                N+. In the inner magnetosphere the plasma is hot and the
                composition is ambiguous, although two superimposed Maxwellians
                are still required to fit the data. These spectra are fit using
                two compositions, one with H+ and N+ and the second with two H+
                components. The N+ composition is preferred by the data provider.
                All fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors.
                It should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for
                the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in this
                region and will effect the density and velocity values. In the
                outbound magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values
                are given for velocity, density, and thermal speed. The
                signal-to-noise ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near
                the magnetopause, which can result in the analysis giving
                incorrect values. The L-long spectra have too low an energy
                resolution to permit accurate determinations parameters in many
                regions temperature and non-radial velocity components may be
            inaccurate.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
