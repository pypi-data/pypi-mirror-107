            <description>THIS BROWSE DATA CONSISTS OF RESAMPLED DATA FROM THE LOW ENERGY
                CHARGED PARTICLE (LECP) EXPERIMENT ON VOYAGER 1 WHILE THE
                SPACECRAFT WAS IN THE VICINITY OF SATURN. THIS INSTRUMENT
                MEASURES THE INTENSITIES OF IN-SITU CHARGED PARTICLES (&gt;26 KEV
                ELECTRONS AND &gt;30 KEV IONS) WITH VARIOUS LEVELS OF
                DISCRIMINATION BASED ON ENERGY, MASS SPECIES, AND ANGULAR ARRIVAL
                DIRECTION. A SUBSET OF ALMOST 100 LECP CHANNELS ARE INCLUDED WITH
                THIS DATA SET. THE LECP DATA ARE GLOBALLY CALIBRATED TO THE
                EXTENT POSSIBLE (SEE BELOW) AND THEY ARE TIME AVERAGED TO ABOUT
                15 MINUTE TIME INTERVALS WITH THE EXACT BEGINNING AND ENDING
                TIMES FOR THOSE INTERVALS MATCHING THE LECP INSTRUMENTAL CYCLE
                PERIODS (THE ANGULAR SCANNING PERIODS). THE LECP INSTUMENT HAS A
                ROTATING HEAD FOR OBTAINING ANGULAR ANISOTROPY MEASUREMENTS OF
                THE MEDIUM ENERGY CHARGED PARTICLES THAT IT MEASURES. THE CYCLE
                TIME FOR THE ROTATION IF VARIABLE, BUT DURING ENCOUNTERS IT IS
                ALWAYS FASTER THAN 15 MINUTES. FOR THIS BROWSE DATA SET ONLY SCAN
                AVERAGE DATA IS GIVEN (NO ANGULAR INFORMATION). THE DATA IS IN
                THE FORM OF 'RATE' DATA WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CONVERTED TO
                THE USUAL PHYSICAL UNITS. THE REASON IS THAT SUCH A CONVERSION
                WOULD DEPEND ON UNCERTAIN DETERMINATIONS SUCH AS THE MASS SPECIES
                OF THE PARTICLES AND THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND. BOTH MASS SPECIES
                AND BACKGROUND ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT DURING THE
                STUDY OF PARTICULAR REGIONS. TO CONVERT 'RATE' TO
                'INTENSITY' FOR A PARTICULAR CHANNEL ONE PERFORMS THE
                FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) DECIDE ON THE LEVEL OF BACKGROUND
                CONTAMINATION AND SUBTRACT THAT OFF THE GIVEN RATE LEVEL.
                BACKGROUND IS TO BE DETERMINED FROM CONTEXT AND FROM MAKING USE
                OF SECTOR 8 RATES (SECTOR 8 HAS A 2 mm AL SHIELD COVERING IT). 2)
                DIVIDE THE BACKGROUND CORRECTED RATE BY THE CHANNEL GEOMETRIC
                FACTOR AND BY THE ENERGY BANDPASS OF THE CHANNEL. THE GEOMETRIC
                FACTOR IS FOUND IN ENTRY 'channel_geometric_ factor' AS
                ASSOCIATED WITH EACH CHANNEL 'channel_id'. TO DETERMINE
                THE ENERGY BANDPASS, ONE MUST JUDGE THE MASS SPECIES OF THE OF
                THE DETECTED PARTICLES (FOR IONS BUT NOT FOR ELECTRONS). THE
                ENERGY BAND PASSES ARE GIVEN IN ENTRIES
                'minimum_instrument_parameter' and
                'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE
                'FPLECPENERGY', AND ARE GIVEN IN THE FORM
                'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. FOR CHANNELS THAT BEGIN THEIR NAMES
                WITH THE DESIGNATIONS 'CH' THESE BANDPASSES CAN BE USED
                ON MASS SPECIES THAT ARE ACCEPTED INTO THAT CHANNEL (SEE ENTRIES
                'minimum_instrument_parameter' and
                'maximum_instrument_ parameter' IN TABLE
                'FPLECPCHANZ', WHICH GIVE THE MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM
                'Z' VALUE ACCEPTED -- THESE ENTRIES ARE BLANK FOR
                ELECTRON CHANNELS). FOR OTHER CHANNELS THE GIVEN BANDPASS REFERS
                ONLY TO THE LOWEST 'Z' VALUE ACCEPTED. THE BANDPASSES
                FOR OTHER 'Z' VALUES ARE NOT ALL KNOWN, BUT SOME ARE
                GIVEN IN THE LITERATURE (E.G. KRIMIGIS ET AL., 1979). THE FINAL
                PRODUCT OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE THE PARTICLE INTENSITY WITH
                THE UNITS: COUNTS/(CM**2.STR.SEC.KEV). SOME CHANNELS ARE SUBJECT
                TO SERIOUS CONTAMINATIONS, AND MANY OF THESE CONTAMINATIONS
                CANNOT BE REMOVED EXCEPT WITH A REGION-BY-REGION ANALYSIS, WHICH
                HAS NOT BEEN DONE FOR THIS DATA. THUS, TO USE THIS DATA IT IS
                ABSOLUTELY VITAL THAT THE CONTAMINATION TYPES
                ('contamination_id' , 'contamination_desc')
                AND THE LEVELS OF CONTAMINATION ('data_quality_id'
                CORRESPONDING TO THE DEFINITIONS 'data_quality_desc')
                BE CAREFULLY EXAMINED FOR ALL REGIONS OF STUDY. A DEAD TIME
                CORRECTION PROCEDURE HAS BEEN APPLIED IN AN ATTEMPT TO CORRECT
                THE LINEAR EFFECTS OF DETECTOR OVERDRIVE (PULSE-PILEUP). THIS
                PROCEDURE DOES NOT FIX SEVERELY OVERDRIVEN DETECTORS. A PROCEDURE
                IS AVAILABLE FOR CORRECTING VOYAGER 2 LECP ELECTRON CONTAMINATION
                OF LOW ENERGY ION CHANNELS, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS HAS BEEN
                EVALUATED ONLY FOR THE URANUS DATA SET. THUS, CORRECTIONS HAVE
            BEEN APPLIED ONLY TO THE URANUS DATA SET.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
