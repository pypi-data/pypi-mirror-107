            <description>The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe proxy
                electron density data set contains electron densities derived using an
                empirical relation between the floating potential and electron
                densities from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer during the entire
                Cassini mission.  This data set also includes the spacecraft potential
                which can be derived from the floating potential.  The submitted data
                set includes spacecraft potential, floating potential, and electron
                density, and is intended to become the most comprehensive and complete
                data set of electron densities and spacecraft potential in Saturn's
                low-density, outer magnetosphere derived from the Langmuir Probe
                floating potential measurement in the Cassini RPWS archive.  Data are
                presented in tables with fixed-length records for ease in data
            handling.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
