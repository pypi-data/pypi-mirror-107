            <description>This file gives the Ne, Te and Vs measurements derived by fitting
                the radial probe voltampere curves taken whenever PVO was within
                the ionosphere (ie., between the inbound and outbound ionopause
                crossings). Data from essentially every orbit in 1979 and 1980
                included ionosphere transits. After the summer of 1980, however,
                periapsis could no longer be maintained at low altitudes, and it
                rose slowly. After April 1981 periapsis was above the altitude of
                the dayside ionopause, so the spacecraft encountered the
                ionosphere only in the terminator regions and on the nightside
                where the ionosphere extends to much higher altitudes. Dayside
                measurements again became available early in 1992 when periapsis
                returned to low enough altitudes. The PVO Entry period of between
                July and October 1992 provided only nightside periapsis data.
                During the intervening period (1981-91), only nightside UADS
                measurements in the high altitude (downstream) ionosphere were
                available. Note that High Resolution Ne data from the 1981-91
                interval provide measurements in the dayside magnetosheath and in
                the solar wind, but these data have limited accuracy because of
                spacecraft photoelectron contributions. See [BRACEETAL1988] for
                further details on the interpretation of High Resolution
            measurements made outside the ionosphere.</description>
