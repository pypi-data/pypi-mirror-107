            <description>The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) edited full
                resolution data set includes all waveform data for the entire
                Cassini mission.  This data set includes uncalibrated values for
                each waveform channel for each sensor for all times during the
                mission including the second Venus flyby, the Earth flyby, the
                Jupiter flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire Saturn tour.
                Data for this data set are acquired from the RPWS Waveform
                Receiver (WFR).  Data are presented in a set of time series
                organized so as to have fixed-length records for ease in data
                handling.  Data from the different WFR modes (i.e. 2.5-kHz and 26
                Hz modes)  are segregated into separate files.  This data set
                includes all waveform data acquired by the RPWS.  A browse data
                set is included with these data which provides for a graphical
                search of the data using a series of thumbnail and full-sized
                spectrograms which lead the user to the particular data file(s) of
                interest.  The waveform data provide the highest resolution data
                from the RPWS instrument in the form of a set of waveform series
                for these two bandwidths and can be used, when data from two
                electric and three magnetic sensors are available, to perform
                wave-normal analyses on various plasma wave phenomena.  These data
                can be used in their original time domain in order to look for
                solitary features such as dust impacts or electrostatic solitary
                waves.  Or, they can be transformed into the frequency domain in
                order to examine the detailed time and spectral evolution of
                plasma waves or radio emissions or to do the wave-normal analysis.
                Usually, this data set includes time series measurements from more
                than one (up to five) sensors at a time and the samples are made
            simultaneously for all five sensors.</description>
