            <description>The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) edited full
                resolution data set includes all wideband waveform data for the
                entire Cassini mission.  This data set includes uncalibrated
                values for each wideband channel for each sensor for all times
                during the mission including the second Venus flyby, the Earth
                flyby, the Jupiter flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire
                Saturn tour.  Data for this data set are acquired from the RPWS
                Wideband Receiver (WBR).  Data are presented in a set of time
                series organized so as to have fixed-length records for ease in
                data handling.  Data from the different WBR modes (i.e. 10-kHz,
                80-kHz, and frequency-translated 80-kHz data)  are segregated into
                separate files.  This data set includes all wideband data acquired
                by the RPWS.  A browse data set is included with these data which
                provides for a graphical search of the data using a series of
                thumbnail and full-sized spectrograms which lead the user to the
                particular data file(s) of interest. The wideband data provide the
                highest resolution data from the RPWS instrument in the form of a
                set of waveform series.  These data can be used in their original
                time domain in order to look for solitary features such as dust
                impacts or electrostatic solitary waves.  Or, they can be
                transformed into the frequency domain in order to examine the
                detailed time and spectral evolution of plasma waves or radio
            emissions.</description>
