            <description>This data set contains Voyager 1 and 2 measurements of the
                brightness of Jupiter at H Lyman alpha and in the H2 Lyman and
                Werner bands shortward of H Lyman alpha. Pointing has been
                corrected by the C-Smithing process, and these data were derived
                from the pre-encounter North-South Map sequences. In this
                sequence, the UVS field of view was located near the central
                meridian of the planet. The field of view stepped slowly from
                north to south, and then rapidly repositioned to the north. These
                scans were repeated until all Jovian longitudes had been sampled.
                Coverage in longitude was not continuous in time. Rather, some
                longitude ranges were covered on the preceding or following
            rotation of Jupiter.</description>
