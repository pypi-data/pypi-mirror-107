            <description>Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists
                of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle
                Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset
                includes 3-Color Multispectral Reduced Data Records for the WAC.
                The 3-Color Map Projected Multispectral RDR (MD3) data set
                consists of a 3-color map of northern and equatorial latitudes
                acquired during MESSENGER's Extended Mission, and includes
                I/F in the 3 filters used for this map. This product has higher
                spatial resolution than, and complements, an 8-color
                multispectral map acquired during the primary mission. This
                product is photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle
                (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle
                (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 128 pixels per degree.
                The map is divided into 'tiles', each representing the
                NW, NE, SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of
                the 2 polar quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already
                defined by the USGS. Each tile is composed of 3 bands
                corresponding to 3 of the 11 WAC filters. Each tile also contains
                backplanes describing ancillary information. The subset of 3 of
                11 available multispectral filters samples both albedo and
                spectral slope over MDIS's wavelength range. The fewer
                colors than in the Primary Mission 8-color product is to balance
                the higher spatial resolution to manage data volume during
            acquisition.</description>
