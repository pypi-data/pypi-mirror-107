            <description>Portable Field Emission Spectrometer (PFES) data were acquired on
                July 15 and 17, 1989. A total of 31 measurements were collected
                for GRSFE. Of these measurements, 13 were calibrations and 18
                were of representative surfaces. The data were collected
                primarily to support the calibration of the TIMS data and to
                assist in interpreting spectral mixing in the mid-infrared. Sites
                were selected for calibration that covered a range of
                emissivities. On July 15, PFES data were collected at Kelso Dunes
                and the Cima Volcanic Field as part of the Calibration Team
                effort. Daedalus and SIRIS data were collected over the same
                sites. For the PFES data, the Kelso Dunes Bright Target site
                represented the silica-rich endmember and the Cima basalt tephra
                Dark Target site represented the more silica-poor endmember. On
                July 17, PFES data were collected at two of the modelling sites
                at Lunar Lake (the playa and the cobble sites). Several spectra
                were also collected at the playa surface next to the Lunar Lake
            thermistor site.</description>
