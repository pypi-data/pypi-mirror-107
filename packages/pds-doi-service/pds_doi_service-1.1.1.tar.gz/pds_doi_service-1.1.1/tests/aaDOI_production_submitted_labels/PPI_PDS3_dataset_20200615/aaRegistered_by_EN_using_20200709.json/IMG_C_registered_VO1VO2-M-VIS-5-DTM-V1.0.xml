            <description>This digital image map of Mars is a cartographic extension of a
                previously released set of CDROM volumes containing individual
                Viking Orbiter Images (PDS volumes VO_1001, VO_1002, etc.). The
                data in the latter are pristine, in the sense that they were
                processed only to the extent required to view them as images.
                They contain the artifacts and the radiometric, geometric, and
                photometric characteristics of the raw data transmitted by the
                spacecraft. This new volume set, on the other hand, contains
                cartographic compilations made by processing the raw images to
                reduce radiometric and geometric distortions and to form
                geodetically controlled Mosaicked Digital Image Models (MDIMs).
                (Because the photometric processing used in this MDIM was
                oversimplified, quantitative radiometric analysis on this data is
                not possible.) It also contains digitized versions of an
                airbrushed map of Mars as well as a listing of all IAU-approved
                feature names. In addition, special geodetic and photogrammetric
                processing has been performed to derive rasters of topographic
                data, or Digital Terrain Models (DTMs). The latter has a format
                similar to that of the MDIM, except that elevation values are
                used in the array instead of image brightness values. The Mars
                DTM exists in its entirety on Volume 7. Finally, Volume 7 has a
                listing of SPICE files derived for the Viking images used in the
                MDIM and the DTM. These files contain updated camera orientation
                matrices for each of the frames. The matrices are by-products of
                the photogrammetric processing for the control network required
            to compile the MDIM and the DTM.</description>
