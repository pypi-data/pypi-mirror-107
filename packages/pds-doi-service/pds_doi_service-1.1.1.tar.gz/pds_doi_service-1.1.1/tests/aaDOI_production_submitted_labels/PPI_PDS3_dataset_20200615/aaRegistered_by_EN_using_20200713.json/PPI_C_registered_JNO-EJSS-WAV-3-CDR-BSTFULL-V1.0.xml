            <description>The Juno Waves calibrated burst waveform full resolution data set
                includes all high rate science electric field waveforms from 50Hz up to
                45.25 MHz and magnetic field waveforms from 50Hz to 20kHz with sample
                rates that depend on the receiver used to obtain the waveforms.  This
                is the complete waveform data set containing all high rate binning mode
                data and record mode data received from Waves from launch until the end
                of mission including initial checkout, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter
                orbits and cruise.
                
                Data are acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High
                Frequency Receiver (HFR) and are typically losslessly compressed on
                board.  These data are presented in binary SERIES objects.  This data
                set comprises highest temporal resolution data obtained by Waves (or all
                other Juno instruments, for that matter).  Pre-rendered spectrograms
                generated from these data are included as well to provide the user with
                a quick view of the content of the data.  This data set should be among
                the last used of any in the Waves archive as it provides highly detailed
                information on very short isolated intervals in time.  The Waves full
            resolution survey data provide context for these data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
