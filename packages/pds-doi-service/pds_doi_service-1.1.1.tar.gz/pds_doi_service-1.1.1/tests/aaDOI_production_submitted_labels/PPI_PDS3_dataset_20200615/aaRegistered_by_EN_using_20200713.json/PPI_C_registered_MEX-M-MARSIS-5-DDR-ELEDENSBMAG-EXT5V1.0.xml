            <description>This data set tabulates local electron densities and local magnetic
                field strengths magnetic field strengths obtained from Mars Advanced
                Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) Active Ionospheric
                Sounding (AIS) mode ionograms.  The electron density is obtained by
                measuring the increment in frequency between the plasma frequency
                harmonics, visible as bright vertical lines at low frequency and delay
                time in many MARSIS ionograms.  Similarly, the local magnetic field
                strength is found by measuring the difference in delay time between
                electron cyclotron echoes, visible as bright horizontal lines at low
                frequency on many ionograms.  Both the measured quantity and the derived
                result are included in the archive product.  We also include a data
                quality flag giving the impression of the archivist as to how reliable
                each result is.  This archive product includes only data from the
            nominal mission, which starts about orbit 1850 and ends on orbit 2539.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
