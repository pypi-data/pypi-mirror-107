            <description>This data set consists of all of the ion moments data generated from
                the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) ion mass spectrometer
                singles or time-of-flight uncalibrated data.
                
                The data set contains the derived ion moments data as follows:
                Ion Moments (ION_MOMT)
                Density, Temperature, Average Flow Speed, Average Flow Velocity
                Ions included are H+, H2+, and W+ (water group ions: O+, OH+, H2O+)
                
                The uncalibrated data were acquired in a mix of CAPS operating modes
                beginning with the first instrument checkout in January 1999 and
                containing throughout the Cassini Tour and through the end of prime
                mission.  The data set covers the time period from 1999-004T03:07:47
                UT until end of prime mission (July 2008).  In addition, it will cover
                data received during extended missions.  Sampling rates were variable
                and depended upon the downlink capabilities and other activities
                on-board.
                
                For times when CAPS is not producing data due to being turned off or
                due to communication issues, the data set will not contain data.
                
                Additionally, there will be no data during times when the calculations
            are not possible.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
