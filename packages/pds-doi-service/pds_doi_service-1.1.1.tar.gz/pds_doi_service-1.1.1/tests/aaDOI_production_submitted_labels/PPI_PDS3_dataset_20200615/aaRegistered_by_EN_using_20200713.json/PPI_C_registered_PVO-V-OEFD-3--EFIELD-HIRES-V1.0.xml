            <description>This data set contains wave electric
                field amplitudes measured at four different frequencies by the Pioneer Venus
                Orbiter Electric Field Detector.  The four frequencies are 100 Hz, 730 Hz,
                5.4 kHz, 30 kHz. The frequency filters are narrow-band, with a 30% bandwidth.
                Thus wave intensities are given in V2/m2/Hz.  The filters are
                continuously active, but data are only provided at a rate determined
                by the spacecraft telemetry rate.  The wave antenna is oriented
                perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis, and so the wave instrument
                measures only wave fields in the spacecraft spin plane.
                Spin modulation of naturally occurring signals can be used to
                obtain two dimensional wave field information.  The wave antenna
                is a small Y-shaped structure, with effective separation of 0.76
                meters. The spin phase of the effective dipole is included
                within the high resolution data set for each of the channels, which
            are sampled at different times.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
