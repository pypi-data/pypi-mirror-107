            <description>Abstract
                ========
                This data set consists of the MESSENGER XRS reduced data record
                (RDR) footprints which are derived from the navigational
                meta-data for each calibrated data record (CDR) whose FOV_STATUS
                is 1 or 3; that is, when the field of view intersects the planet
                and is either partially or entirely sunlit. Each XRS
                observation results in four X-ray spectra. When an X-ray
                interacts with one of the four detectors, a charge or voltage
                pulse is generated. This signal is converted into one of 2^8
                (256) channels, which are correlated to energy. Over a commanded
                integration time period a histogram of counts as a function of
                energy (channel number) is recorded. The EDRs are the number of
                events in each channel of the four detectors accumulated over the
                integration period. Channels above or below the useful energy
                range of the detectors are not transmitted. The result is three
                244-channel GPC histograms and one 231-channel solar monitor
                histogram, each of which is designated as a single X-ray spectrum.
                
                Each observation is calibrated and processed into the CDR data
                set. For each CDR whose field of view is contained or partially
                contained on the planetary surface, a footprint is computed
                that corresponds to the perimeter of the planetary region within
                the instrument field of view during the integration time of the
            observation.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
