            <description>The Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
                designed for cosmic ray studies. It consists
                of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy
                Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET). The
                detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster)
                and long electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low
                power consumption and good stability. Normally, the data are
                primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]
                and E) pulse-height information about individual events.
                Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and
                Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
                single detectors and various coincidence rates. In inter-
                planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence
                with the primary detectors to reduce the background from
                high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the
                telescopes. These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian
                magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became
                high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired
                counts. Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were
                sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating
            particles, was small.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
