            <description>The Juno MWR EDR data set will ultimately include all uncalibrated MWR
                science data records for the entire Juno mission.  This volume will
                contain only those data obtained through the cruise phase of the Juno
                mission, when this phase of the mission is completed. The objective for
                these data is to provide calibration for the MWR instrument; however,
                it is anticipated that they may someday be useful for astrophysics.
                This volume consists of reformatted and uncalibrated data records. The
                reformatting operation reassembles received instrument data packets
                into one-hour-long records of time-ordered data corresponding to 100-ms
                observations made by the MWR instrument. This data set is intended to
                preserve the full content of the uncalibrated instrument packets
                and is to be used only as a last resort.  The level 3 MWR archived data
            are designed to be complete and more easily used.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
