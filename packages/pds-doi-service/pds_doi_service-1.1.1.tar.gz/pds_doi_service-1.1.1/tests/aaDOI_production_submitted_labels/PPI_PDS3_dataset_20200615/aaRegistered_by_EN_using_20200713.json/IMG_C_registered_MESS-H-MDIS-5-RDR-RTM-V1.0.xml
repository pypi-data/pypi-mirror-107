            <description>Abstract
                ========
                The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide
                Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a
                common pivot platform. This dataset include regional mosaics of
                targeted observations directed at specific regions of interest.
                Four types of targeted observations are included:
                (a) WAC 3-color targeted observations acquired mainly during
                the primary mission, to complement 1 km/pixel 8-color mapping
                with a higher spatial resolution 3-color product;
                (b) WAC observations of targets that were observed repeatedly at
                different photometric geometries in order to improve photometric
                models of Mercury; these were observed initially in 8 color and
                since early 2013 in 11 colors;
                (c) WAC 8- or 11-color science targeted observations; and
                (d) NAC image strips acquired either for high-resolution imaging of
                morphology or as context for MASCS or MLA observations.
                The images in each observation share a common SITE_ID in the
                file name and PDS label. The SITE_ID corresponds to a targeting
                request entered into a database, in response to which a series of
                images was acquired. There is one SITE_ID for each time the
                region of interest is observed; thus for photometry targets,
                the same geographic region of interest is covered by many sets
                of images, each set sharing a common SITE_ID and distinct
                photometric geometry.
                
                Each mosaic is map projected in an orthographic projection, and
                contains one or more image planes. NAC mosaics contain 4 backplanes:
                observation ID, solar incidence angle, emission angle, and phase
                angle. WAC color products contain 3 backplanes: solar incidence angle,
            emission angle, and phase angle.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
