            <description>This data set contains the best
                estimates of the total ion density from Voyager 2 at Jupiter in the PLS
                voltage range (10-5950 eV/Q). It is calculated using the method of
                which to first order consists of taking the total measured current and
                dividing by the collector area and plasma bulk velocity. This method is
                only accurate for high mach number flows directly into the detector, and
                may result in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the
                outer magnetosphere. Thus absolute densities should be treated with
                caution, but density variations in the data set can be trusted. The low
                resolution mode density is used at all times except day 190 2100-2200 when
                the larger of the high and low resolution mode densities in a 96 sec
                period is used. Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a constant
                velocity component of 200 km/s into the D cup is used outside of this.
                Data format: column 1 is time (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2 is
                the moment density in cm^-3. Each row has format (a24, 1x, 1pe9.2). Values
                of -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained from the
                data using the standard analysis technique. Additional information about
                this data set and the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere
            in this catalog.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
