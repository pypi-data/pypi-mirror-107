            <description>This data set consists of 48-second
                calibrated, averaged wave electric field intensities from the Voyager 2
                Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the
                Jovian magnetosphere. For each 48-second interval, a geometric average
                field strength is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer
                channels whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz
                and which are logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per
                decade. The time associated with each set of averages is the beginning
                of the averaging interval. Averages are stored in units of volt/meter.
                During data gaps where complete 48-second intervals are missing, no
                entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or
                tagged in any other way. Additional information about this data set and
            the instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
