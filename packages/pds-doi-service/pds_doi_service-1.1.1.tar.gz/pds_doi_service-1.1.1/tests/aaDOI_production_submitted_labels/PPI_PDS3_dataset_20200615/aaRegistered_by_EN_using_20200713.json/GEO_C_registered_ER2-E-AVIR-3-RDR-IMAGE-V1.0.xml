            <description>The Airborne Visible and Infared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)
                data are divided into 10x10 square kilometer scenes for purposes
                of standard product generation. More than 40 scenes were
                generated during GRSFE, more than 20 of which are included on the
                CD-ROMs, covering a variety of surfaces. Lunar Crater was covered
                several times in one day (under clear atmospheric conditions) in
                order to evaluate atmospheric scattering and absorption removal
                algorithms and to explore extraction of roughness information
                using variable incidence angle AVIRIS data. The AVIRIS
                multi-temporal data were acquired at the same time that
                ground-based, multi-spectral measurements of atmospheric optical
                depth, and sky radiance at varying scattering angles were
                acquired, along with surface bidirectional reflectance data.
                Accurate wavelength calibration of AVIRIS was performed by JPL
                using laboratory measurements acquired before and after the
                AVIRIS flights. An additional check on the wavelength calibration
                can be made by comparing the positions of known atmospheric
            absorption features to their locations in actual AVIRIS data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
