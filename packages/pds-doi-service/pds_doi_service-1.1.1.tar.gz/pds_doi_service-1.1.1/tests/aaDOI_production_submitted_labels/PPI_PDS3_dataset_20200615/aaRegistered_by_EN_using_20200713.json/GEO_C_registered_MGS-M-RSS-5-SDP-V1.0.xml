            <description>This data set contains archival results from radio science
                investigations conducted during the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)
                mission. Radio measurements were made using the MGS spacecraft
                and Earth-based stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).
                The data set includes high-resolution spherical harmonic models
                of Mars' gravity field generated by groups at the Jet
                Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center, covariance
                matrices for some models, and maps for some models; these results
                were derived from raw radio tracking data. Also included are
                profiles of atmospheric temperature and pressure and ionospheric
                electron density, derived from phase measurements collected
                during radio occultations. The data set also includes analyses of
                transient surface echoes observed close to occultations during
                the first few years of MGS operations. The atmospheric and
                surface investigations were conducted by Radio Science Team
                members at Stanford University. The data set also includes 93
                line-of-sight acceleration profiles derived at JPL from radio
                tracking data collected near periapsis while Mars Global Surveyor
                was in its Science Phasing Orbit and below its nominal Mapping
                altitude of 400 km. The data were delivered to PDS in
                approximately chronological order at the rate of one CD-WO volume
            (typically 100 MB) every three months.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
