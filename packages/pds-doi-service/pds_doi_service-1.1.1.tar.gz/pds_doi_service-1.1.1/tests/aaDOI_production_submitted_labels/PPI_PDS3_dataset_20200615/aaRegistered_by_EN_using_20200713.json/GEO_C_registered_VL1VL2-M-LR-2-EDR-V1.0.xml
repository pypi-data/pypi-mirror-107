            <description>The Labeled Release (LR) instrument on each Viking Lander
                operated throughout the Primary Mission and continued into the
                Extended Mission. The basic analysis cycle for the Labeled
                Release experiment was to deliver a sample of martian soil to one
                of four test cells, seal the cell and moisten the soil with an
                aqueous solution of carbon-14 labeled organic media. A second
                nutrient injection was typically done about 7-8 Mars days after
                the first injection. The test cell was continuously monitored for
                the release of radioactive labeled gas as an indicator of
                heterotrophic metabolism. Viking Lander 1 (VL1) conducted four
                analysis cycles with two nutrient injections for cycles 1, 2, and
                4 and three injections for cycle 3. Viking Lander 2 (VL2)
                conducted five analysis cycles. The first four cycles had two
                nutrient injections each, and the fifth cycle had one injection

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
