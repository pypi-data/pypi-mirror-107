            <description>This data set consists of resampled data from the Low Energy
                Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 2 while the
                spacecraft was in the vicinity of Jupiter. This instrument
                measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (&gt;26 keV
                electrons and &gt;30 keV ions) with various levels of
                discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular
                arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are
                included with this data set. The LECP data are globally
                calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are
                time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact
                beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the
                LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods).
                
                The data is in the form of 'rate' data which has not been
                converted  to the usual physical units.
                
                Data records for the version 1.1 data set provide all data for a
                given channel and time period (8 sectors, plus the average for all
            sectors) in a single record.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
