            <description>This data set includes full resolution
                electric and magnetic wave spectra obtained during a ~ 15-minute period
                of contiguous observations near the closest approach to Ida and a number
                of non-contiguous spectra taken prior to closest approach.  In addition
                waveform survey data (uncalibrated) and all instrument housekeeping data
                are included.  The parameters provided for both the electric and magnetic
                field spectral data are uncalibrated data numbers.  Software and
                calibration tables provided as part of this data set allow for fully
                calibrated data for the electric field measurements in raw data numbers,
                voltage at the antenna inputs (V), electric field (V/m), electric field
                spectral density (V**2/m**2/Hz), or power flux (W/m**2/Hz).  The magnetic
                field measurements can be provided in units of magnetic field spectral
                density (nT**2/Hz).  The sources of these data are the High Frequency
                Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum Analyzer which make up
                the Low Rate Science portion of the PWS. During the included time
                interval, the instrument cycled between the electric and magnetic antennas
                for the Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer.  The High
                Frequency Receiver is always connected to the electric antenna.  Hence,
                for the Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer, the temporal
                resolution for electric measurements is basically one spectrum per 37.33
                seconds.  For the High Frequency Receiver, the time between spectra is
                18.67 seconds.  Note that the lowest 14 High Frequency Receiver channels
                are sampled twice per 18.67 seconds while the remaining channels are
                sampled only once.  The four Spectrum Analyzer channels are each sampled
            7 times in an 18.67 sec interval.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
