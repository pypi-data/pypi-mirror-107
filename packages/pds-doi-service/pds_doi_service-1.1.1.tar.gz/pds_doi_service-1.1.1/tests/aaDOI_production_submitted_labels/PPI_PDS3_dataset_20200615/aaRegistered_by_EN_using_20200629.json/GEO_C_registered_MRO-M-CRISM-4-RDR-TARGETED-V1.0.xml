            <description>This volume contains the CRISM Targeted Empirical Record (TER)
                archive, a collection of multiband image cubes derived from
                targeted (gimbaled) observations of Mars' surface acquired
                by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars
                (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)
                spacecraft. Post-processing attempts to represent the spectrum
                the instrument would have measured looking at the surface of Mars
                at a standard illumination geometry, in the absence of
                atmospheric gases, with aerosol scattering normalized to that at
                the geometry within the observation that is closest to nadir, in
                the absence of instrument artifacts. A series of value added
                products represent spatial variability in signatures of minerals
                of interest. The data are still in sensor space, allowing map
                projection using terrain models of the Martian surface that are
                of better accuracy or spatial resolution than was used to
                generate the companion Map-projected Targeted Reduced Data Record
            (MTR) archive.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
