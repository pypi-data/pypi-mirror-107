            <description>The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) calibrated
                summary key parameter data set includes reduced temporal and
                spectral resolution spectral information calibrated in units of
                spectral density for the entire Cassini mission.  This data set
                includes calibrated values binned and averaged within 1 minute by
                0.1 decade spectral channels for all times during the mission
                including the two Venus flybys, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter
                flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire Saturn tour.  Data
                for this data set are acquired by the RPWS Low Frequency Receiver
                (LFR), Medium Frequency Receiver (MFR), and High Frequency
                Receiver (HFR).  Data are presented in a set of
                fixed-record-length tables.  This data set is intended to provide
                numerical summary data which can be used in conjunction with other
                Cassini fields and particles key parameter data sets to establish
                trends, select events, or simply as a browse data set for the
                Cassini RPWS archive.  This data set should be among the first
                used by a user of any of the RPWS archive as it will lead one to
                information required to search for more detailed or highly
            specialized products.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
