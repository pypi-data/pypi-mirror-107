            <description>High resolution radar map compiled from measurements made between
                1981 and 1984 with the 70 cm wavelength radar at Arecibo
                Observatory. The data have resolutions ranging from 2 to 5
                kilometers. The pixel spacing is 0.1 degrees in latitude and
                longitude. The point at line 1000 and sample 1000 corresponds to
                0 degrees latitude and 0 degrees longitude. The pixel values are
                scaled to represent 20 * log10 (backscattered power). Observed
                power has been corrected for antenna beam, scattering area and
                scattering law. Observed power of 1000, which is the lunar
                average, thus has a value of 60 in the data set. Radar was
                transmitted in left-hand circular polarization, and both
                right-hand circular polarization (i.e. polarized) and left-hand
            circular polarization (i.e. depolarized) echoes were received.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
