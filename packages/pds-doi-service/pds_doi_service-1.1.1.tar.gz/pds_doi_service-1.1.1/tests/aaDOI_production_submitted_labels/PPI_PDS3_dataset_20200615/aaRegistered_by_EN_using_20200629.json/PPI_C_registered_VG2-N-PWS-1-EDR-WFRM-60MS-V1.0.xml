            <description>This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from
                the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver waveform receiver obtained
                during the Neptune encounter. The waveforms are collections of
                4-bit samples of the electric field measured by the dipole
                electric antenna at a rate of 28,800 samples per second. 1600
                samples are collected in 55.56 msec followed by a 4.44-msec gap.
                Each 60-msec interval constitutes a line of waveform samples. The
                data set includes about 271 frames of waveform samples consisting
                of up to 800 lines, each. The telemetry format for the waveform
                data is identical to that for images, hence the use of line and
                frame as constructs in describing the form of the data. The
                waveform is sampled through a bandpass filter with a passband of
                40 Hz to 12 kHz. The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital values
                of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but the
                amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain
                control used in the waveform receiver. The instantaneous dynamic
                range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 db, but the
                automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the passband
                to be set at the optimum level to fit within the instantaneous
                dynamic range. With the gain control, the overall dynamic range
                of the waveform receiver is about 100 db. The automatic gain
                control gain setting is not returned to the ground, hence, there
                is no absolute calibration for the data. However, by comparing
                the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier transforming the
                waveform to the spectrum provided by the spectrum analyzer data,
                an absolute calibration may be obtained in most cases. The data
                may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform useful for
                studying events such as dust impacts on the spacecraft. But the
                normal method of analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier
                transforming the samples from each line to arrive at an amplitude
                versus frequency spectrum. By stacking the spectra side-by-side
                in time order, a frequency-time spectrogram can be produced.
                Additional information about this dataset and the instrument
                which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog. An
                overview of the data in this data set can be found in Gurnett et
                al. [1989] and a complete instrument description can be found in
            Scarf and Gurnett [1977].</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
