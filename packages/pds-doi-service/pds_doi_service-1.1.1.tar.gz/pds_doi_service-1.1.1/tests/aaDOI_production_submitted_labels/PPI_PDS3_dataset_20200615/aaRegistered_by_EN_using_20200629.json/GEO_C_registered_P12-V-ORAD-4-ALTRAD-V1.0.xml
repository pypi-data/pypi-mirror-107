            <description>This data set consists of groups of measurements made by the
                Radar Mapper experiment on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter spacecraft.
                The measurements were made during each approximately 12-second
                spacecraft rotation period for a period of 32 minutes on either
                side of periapsis, when the range to the surface was less than
                about 4500 kilometers. During those 12 seconds, up to 8
                measurements were made: (a) cold-sky received calibration when
                the antenna pointed to the zenith, (b) 'early' imaging,
                when the antenna pointer at an angle of between 10 and 40 degrees
                from nadir, (c) planetary thermal noise temperature when the
                antenna pointed to the nadir (d) one altimetry measurement, or
                (d-g) four altimetry measurements, and (h) 'late'
                imaging, when the antenna again pointed at an angle of between 10
                and 40 degrees from nadir, but on the other side from
            'early' imaging.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
