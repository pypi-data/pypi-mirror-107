            <description>Abstract
                ========
                This data set consists of the JUNO JEDI (Jupiter Energetic-Particle
                Detector) calibrated observations, also known as CDRs. The system
                is made up of 3 instrument subsystems (pucks) aligned in three
                directions on the spinning JUNO spacecraft. The pucks each have 6 look
                directions (telescopes) with a time of flight (TOF) and a deposited
                energy detection (SSD) system.  In addition, the pulse height of the
                signal in the TOF system can be used for energy measurement. The
                instruments can be operated in a variety of modes, differing in the
                way they use and combine these measurements. More details are available
                in the INSTRUMENT.CAT file and the JEDI SIS.
                
                The CDRs are organized in files covering one day of spacecraft event
                time (SCET). There are potentially 10 different files per puck,
                corresponding to the available data gathering modes: HIERSESP,
                HIERSISP, HIERSTOFXER, HIERSTOFXPHR, LOERSESP, LOERSISP, LOERSTOFXER,
                LOERSTOFXPHR, NONPTOFXER, NONPTOFXPHR. Depending on how the pucks are
                operated, not all data types will be available for all pucks for any
                particular time range.
                
                All the measured quantities present in the uncalibrated data files
                (EDRs) are present here in three forms: counts per accumulation (the
                same numbers as in the EDRs), counts per second (this number may be
                corrected for instrument saturation and background), intensity (counts
                per second per steradian per cm2 per keV). Additional support
                quantities are also included for the convenience or enlightenment of
            the end user.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
