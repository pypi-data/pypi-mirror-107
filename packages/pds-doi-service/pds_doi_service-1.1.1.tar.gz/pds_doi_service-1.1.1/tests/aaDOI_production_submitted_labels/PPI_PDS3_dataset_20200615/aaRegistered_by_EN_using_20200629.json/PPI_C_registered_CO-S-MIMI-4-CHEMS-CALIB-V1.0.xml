            <description>The Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument(MIMI) Charge Energy Mass
                Spectrometer (CHEMS) contains a deflection system and an overall field
                of view of 159 x 4 deg. that is comprised of three distinct energetic
                particle telescopes each having a field of view of 53 x 4. All
                telescopes share the same deflection mechanism, but each has its own
                start and stop microchannel plate (MCP) and its own solid-state
                detector (SSD). Much of the data returned by CHEMS is separated by
                telescope. The deflection plate power supply (DPPS) has 32 different
                voltages that can be applied across the deflection plates. For any
                single DPPS step, the electrostatic analyzer only transmits incoming
                ions within a narrow range of energy per charge (a 3% pass band).
                
                The CHEMS calibrated data set includes the Pulse Height Analysis (PHA)
                data collected during the Saturn tour. CHEMS PHA provides a list of
                individually detected particles, with specific detection parameters
                for each event, including TOF, energy deposited in the SSD, and
                telescope number.
                
                The energy per charge data for six ion species (H+, He+, H2+, He++,
                O++, W+)  are presented in two forms. (The W+ water ion group includes
                O+, OH+, H20+ and H30+). One form is a set of tables which are of
                variable length and use a comma to separate various fields, and the
                other is a PDF file containing the energy per charge spectrograms and
                are based on CHEMS PHA data.
                
                The original data has been decommutated and decoded by software at the
                Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and calibrated and further processed
                by software at the University of Maryland.
                
                This data set should be among the first used by a user of any of the
                MIMI CHEMS archive as it will lead one to information required to
                search for more detailed or highly specialized features in the
            original data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
