            <description>The archived data consist of count rates from the sum of two
                hemispherical detectors covering 4 pi steradians and operating
                continuously. The detectors are 3 mm thick CsI scintillators
                coupled to photomultiplier tubes. The nominal energy range is
                25-150 keV, but the below table should be consulted to find the
                accurate thresholds for any day of the mission. A more complete
                description of the instrument may be found in [HURLEYETAL1992]
                and [COTINETAL1983]. Although the prime objectives of this
                investigation are the study of solar and cosmic x- and gamma-ray
                bursts, it should be noted that the experiment is also sensitive
                to solar protons and electrons. The former deposit energy
                directly in the scintillator if they are energetic enough, while
                the latter may produce x- radiation locally by bremsstrahlung.
                Thus although the counting rates are generally stable at about
                500 c/s over the long term, there are periods of weeks to a month
                or so when the rates increase considerably due to particles.
                Examples may be found in March 1991 (solar protons) and February
                1992 (particles in the Jovian magnetosphere). The time resolution
                of the data takes on one of four values depending on the
                telemetry rate and instrument operating mode: 0.25, 0.5, 1, or 2
            seconds.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
