            <description>This volume contains the archive of Lunar brightness temperature
                data derived from images acquired by the Clementine Long
                Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) camera. The LWIR camera acquired
                approximately 220,000 thermal-infrared images of the lunar
                surface that were used to generate the brightness temperature
                images within this archive. The procedure for generating
                brightness temperature values can be summarized as follows: 1)
                original LWIR digital numbers were converted to radiance; 2) the
                dark current signal was subtracted from the radiance values; 3) a
                flat field correction was applied; 4) bad pixels were identified
                and smoothed over; and 5) calibrated radiance values were
            converted to brightness temperatures using the Planck function.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
