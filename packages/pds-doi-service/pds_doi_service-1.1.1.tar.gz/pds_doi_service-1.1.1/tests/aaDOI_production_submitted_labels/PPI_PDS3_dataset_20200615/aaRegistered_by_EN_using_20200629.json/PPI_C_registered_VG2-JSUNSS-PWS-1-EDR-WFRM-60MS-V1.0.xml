            <description>The Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Spectrometer (PWS) raw full resolution
                data set consists of electric field waveform samples from the
                Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained during
                the entire mission. Data will continue to be added to the archive
                on subsequent volumes. The data set encompasses all waveform
                observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before,
                between, and after the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune
                encounter phases as well as those obtained during the four
                encounter phases. Data for this data set are acquired from the
                PWS waveform receiver. Data are presented as time series of 4-bit
                voltage measurements acquired at the rate of 28,800 samples per
                second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter. An automatic
                gain control is used to keep the signal within the usable range
                of the 4-bit digitization, however, the gain information is not
                returned to the ground, hence, there is no direct, absolute
                calibration. However, a power spectrum analysis returns a
                spectrum that has accurate relative amplitudes between spectral
                elements. This data set provides the highest temporal resolution
                data from the Voyager mission. A browse data set is included with
                these data which provides for a graphical search of the data
                using a series of thumbnail and full-sized spectrograms which
            lead the user to the particular data file(s) of interest.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
