            <description>THIS DATA SET CONTAINS THE THERMAL ELECTRON DENSITY AND
                TEMPERATURE IN THE PLS ENERGY RANGE (10-5950 EV) FROM VOYAGER 1
                AT SATURN DERIVED BY FITTING THE LOW ENERGY ELECTRON COMPONENT
                WITH A MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTION, AND THE MOMENT DENSITY AND
                TEMPERATURE OF THE HOT ELECTRONS CALCULATED AFTER THE SIGNAL FROM
                THE THERMAL COMPONENT IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE ELECTRON SPECTRA. IT
                IS A SUBSET OF THE DATA SET VG1-S-PLS-5-ELE-FIT-96.0SEC WHICH
                SHOULD BE OBTAINED BEFORE THIS DATA IS USED. SPACECRAFT CHARGING
                MAY RESULT IN FACTOR OF 2-3 ERRORS IN THE THERMAL ELECTRON
                DENSITY. THE FIRST SIX COLUMNS ARE THE TIME TAG (YEAR, DAY, HOUR,
                MIN, SEC, MSEC), COLUMN 7 AND 8 ARE THE FIT DENSITY AND
                TEMPERATURE OF THE THERMAL ELECTRON COMPONENT, AND 9 AND 10 ARE
                THE MOMENT DENSITY AND TEMPERATURE OF THE SUPRATHERMAL ELECTRONS.
                EACH ROW HAS THE FORMAT (6I5,4E12.4). VALUES OF 1.E32 INDICATE
                THAT THE PARAMETER COULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE DATA USING THE
                STANDARD ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
                DATASET AND THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PRODUCED IT CAN BE FOUND
                ELSEWHERE IN THIS CATALOG. AN OVERVIEW OF THE DATA IN THIS DATA
                SET CAN BE FOUND IN SITTLER ET AL. (1983) AND A COMPLETE
            INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION CAN BE FOUND IN BRIDGE (1977).</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
