            <description>The Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument(MIMI) Imaging Neutral
                Camera (INCA) uncalibrated data set includes all data collected from
                the MIMI Data Processing Unit during the mission.  The original data
                has been decommutated and decoded by software at the Applied Physics
                Laboratory (APL) and has been then further ordered and filtered by
                software at Fundamental Technologies, LLC. The data is provided in
                an uncalibrated form in conjunction with a PDS MIMI calibration
                volume COMIMI_0000 which provides specific algorithms for the
                derivation of calibrated data. This data set includes uncalibrated
                values of counts in the form of rates and of rate images for the
                INCA sensor for all times during the mission including the Earth
                flyby, the Jupiter flyby, interplanetary cruise, and the entire
                Saturn tour.  Data are presented in a set of tables which are of
                variable length and use a comma to separate various fields.  This
                data set is intended to be the most comprehensive and complete data
                set included in the Cassini MIMI INCA archive.  A browse data set is
                included with Key Parameter data that is calibrated using the
                algorithms provided in the Calibration volume. In addition, a series
                of images are provided with the KP browse data that displays the KP
                data which can lead the user to the particular times of interest.
                This data set should be among the first used by a user of any of the
                MIMI INCA archive as it will lead one to information required to
                search for more detailed or highly specialized features in the
            original data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
