            <description>This far encounter data set consists of electron and ion
                counting rate data from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
                experiment on Voyager 2 while the spacecraft was within the
                vicinity of Uranus. This instrument measures the intensities
                of in-situ charged particles ( &gt;13 keV electrons and &gt;24 keV
                ions) with various levels of discrimination based on energy
                range and mass species. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels
                are included in this data set. The LECP data are globally
                calibrated to the extent possible.  During Uranus far
                encounter, the entire LEPT (Low Energy Particle Telescope)
                and part of the LEMPA (Low Energy Magnetospheric Particle
                Analyzer) subsystems were turned on for data collection.
                Particles include electrons, protons, alpha particles, and
                light, medium, and heavy nuclei particles.  The far encounter
                data are 0.4 second rate measurements within 1/8 of the LECP
                instrumental motor rotation period (the angular scanning
            periods, or step period).</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
