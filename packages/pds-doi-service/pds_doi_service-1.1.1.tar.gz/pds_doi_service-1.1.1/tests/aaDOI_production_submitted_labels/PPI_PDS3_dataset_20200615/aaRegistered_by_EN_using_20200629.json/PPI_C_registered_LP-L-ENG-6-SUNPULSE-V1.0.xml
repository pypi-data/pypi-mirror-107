            <description>The sun pulse data set is a record of times that the Lunar
                Prospector sun sensor detects the Sun. These sun pulse times are
                derived from ground processing of the sun sensor data, earth-moon
                limb sensor data, and the spacecraft ephemeris. This data set is
                part of the Lunar Prospector Level 0 data archive. The sun pulse
                times are used in determining the spacecraft spin rate and
                orientation as a function of time. Because the Lunar Prospector
                spacecraft is sometimes in eclipse with the Sun, the sun pulse
                data set is generated on the ground to include both actual sun
                pulse times based on the sun sensor measurements and estimated
                sun pulse times based on the history of spin rate change during
            all prior eclipses.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
