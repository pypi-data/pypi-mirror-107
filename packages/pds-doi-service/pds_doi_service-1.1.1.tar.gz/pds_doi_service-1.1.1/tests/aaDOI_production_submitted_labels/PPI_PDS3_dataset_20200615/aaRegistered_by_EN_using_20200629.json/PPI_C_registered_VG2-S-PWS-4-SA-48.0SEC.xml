            <description>This data set consists of 48-second calibrated, averaged wave
                electric field intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave
                Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the
                Saturnian magnetosphere. For each 48-second interval, a geometric
                average field strength is determined for each of the 16 spectrum
                analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to
                56.2 kilo- Hertz and which are logarithmically spaced in
                frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated with
                each set of averages is the beginning of the averating interval.
                Averages are stored in units of volt/meter. During data gaps
                where complete 48-second intervals are missing, no entries exist
                in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in
                any other way. Additional information about this dataset and the
                instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this
                catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found in
                Scarf et al. [1982] and a complete instrument description can be
            found in Scarf and Gurnett [1977].</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
