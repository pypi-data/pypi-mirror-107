            <description>Abstract ======== This data set consists of the MESSENGER XRS
                reduced data record observations, also known as RDRs, which are
                derived from the calibrated data records, CDRs. Each XRS
                observation results in four X-ray spectra. When an X-ray
                interacts with one of the four detectors, a charge or voltage
                pulse is generated. This signal is converted into one of 2^8
                (256) channels, which are correlated to energy. Over a commanded
                integration time period a histogram of counts as a function of
                energy (channel number) is recorded. The EDRs are the number of
                events in each channel of the four detectors accumulated over the
                integration period. Channels above or below the useful energy
                range of the detectors are not transmitted. The result is three
                244-channel GPC histograms and one 231-channel solar monitor
                histogram, each of which is designated as a single X-ray
                spectrum. Each observation is calibrated and processed into the
                CDR data set and then further processed to produce a map of
            elemental ratios, the maps of which compose the RDR data set.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
