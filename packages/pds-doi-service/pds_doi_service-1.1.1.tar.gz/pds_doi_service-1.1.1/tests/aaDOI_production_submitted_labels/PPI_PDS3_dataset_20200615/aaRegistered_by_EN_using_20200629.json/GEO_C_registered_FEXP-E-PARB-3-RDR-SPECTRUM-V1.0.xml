            <description>PARABOLA data were obtained at three GRSFE modeling sites in the
                Lunar Crater Volcanic Field. The playa site, the cobble site, and
                the mantled flow site. Each site was imaged by PARABOLA at a
                variety of solar incidence angles to characterize the scattering
                properties of the surface completely. This information can be
                used as a reference to correct airborne data from ASAS and AVIRIS
                from any lighting and viewing geometry, or as a base data set to
                test radiative transfer models. Six sets of data from the playa
                site were gathered primarily on July 17, 1989 with solar
                incidence angles that varied from 28 to 71 degrees. Five sets of
                cobble site data were gathered during the morning of July 18,
                1989 with incidence angles from 19 to 57 degrees. Data from the
                mantled flow site was obtained six times during the afternoon of
                July 18 with incidence angles from 21 to 73 degrees. In all, over
                1000 data points exist for each site to characterize its
                scattering properties. Additionally, an equal number of points
            exist for the sky above the sites.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
