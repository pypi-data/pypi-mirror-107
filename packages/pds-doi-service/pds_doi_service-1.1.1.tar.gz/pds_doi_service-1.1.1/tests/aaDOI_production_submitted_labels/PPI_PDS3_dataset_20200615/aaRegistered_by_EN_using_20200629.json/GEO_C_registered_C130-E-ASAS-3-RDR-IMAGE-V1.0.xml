            <description>Most of the ASAS data acquired for GRSFE were taken during
                flights over Lunar Lake, Nevada, at a nominal altitude of 5000 m
                above ground level. Flights over Lunar Lake were repeated to
                acquire data for a range of solar zenith angles and to obtain
                data for several view azimuth angles (i.e., for several flight
                headings relative to the solar principal plane). On most flights,
                the sensor field of view was initially pointed forward 45 degrees
                as the aircraft approached the site. The sensor then imaged the
                site through a sequence of seven fore-to-aft view directions
                ranging from 45 degrees forward to 45 degrees aft in 15 degree
                increments as the aircraft flew over the site. The primary target
                of interest was the Lunar Lake playa, but the digital images also
                include data for the lava flow and cobble areas within and around
                the playa. Data were acquired in a similar manner on one flight
                over the Ubehebe Crater. One flight over Lunar Lake was also
                flown approximately along the solar principal plane with the ASAS
                view zenith angle fixed at the solar zenith angle. The purpose of
            this flight was to observe the opposition effect.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
