            <description>This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the
                Extended Operations (ENT) phase of the Venus Express (VEX)
                mission using ground facilities of the NASA Deep Space Network
                (DSN). This data set will be combined with other data collected
                using antennas of the European Space Agency (ESA) and submitted
                to the ESA Planetary Science Archive. These observations were
                designed to determine the gravity field of Venus; density of the
                upper atmosphere through drag measurements; the
                temperature-pressure and absorption structure of the neutral
                Venus atmosphere; and the electron density profile of the
                ionosphere. No bistatic radar (BSR) and solar conjunction (SCO)
                observations were conducted during the ENT phase because of a 15
                dB degradation in performance of the S-Band radio system in late
                2006 (before ENT began). Of most interest in the ENT archive will
                be the Radio Science Receiver (RSR) files in the RSR directory,
                which provided the raw input to the radio occultation
                investigations of the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and the
                Orbit Data Files (ODFs), which provided the raw input to gravity
                and drag investigations. The ENT phase, for purposes of this
                archive, began after the completion of the Routine Operations
                Phase (2007-10-02, the end of the primary mission) and continued
            to the end of the VEX mission.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
