            <description>This data set contains calibrated and resampled engineering
                (e.g., star tracker data and timing) and science data acquired
                from the Lunar Gravity and Ranging System (LGRS) on the two
                spacecraft comprising the Gravity Recovery and Interior
                Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. The data in the set are at NASA Level
                1 and have been archived for general use. Products in this set
                have been derived from NASA Level 0 (the LGRS EDR data set) by
                the GRAIL Science Data System (SDS). The observations were used
                to generate high-resolution gravity field models of the Moon. The
                data set includes all of the Level 1 LGRS data from the GRAIL
            mission (March-December 2012).</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
