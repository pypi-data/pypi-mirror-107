            <description>THIS DATA SET CONTAINS THE ION DENSITIES, TEMPERATURES, AND
                VELOCITIES OBTAINED FROM VOYAGER 1 PLS DATA (VOLTAGE RANGE
                10-5950 EV/Q) AT SATURN BY FITTING THE MEASURED SPECTRA WITH
                ISOTROPIC MAXWELLIAN DISTRIBUTIONS. IT IS A SUBSET OF THE DATA
                SET VG1-S-PLS-5-ION-FIT-96.0SEC WHICH SHOULD BE OBTAINED BEFORE
                THIS DATA IS USED. ONLY SPECTRA WHICH HAD DISTINCT CURRENT PEAKS
                WERE FIT. SPECTRA WERE FIT USING ONE OR TWO ION SPECIES, PROTONS
                AND/OR A HEAVY ION WHICH WAS TAKEN TO BE OXYGEN. OUTSIDE L=10-12
                ION SPECTRA CHANGE RAPIDLY, SO THE VALUES IN THIS DATA SET DO NOT
                REPRESENT AVERAGE PLASMA CONDITIONS IN THE OUTER MAGNETOSPHERE. A
                COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF THIS DATA SET IS GIVEN IN RICHARDSON
                (1986). DATA FORMAT: FIRST 5 COLUMNS ARE TIME TAG (YEAR, DAY,
                HOUR, MIN SEC.MSEC), FOLLOWED BY PROTON DENSITY (CM-3), PROTON
                TEMPERATURE (EV), HEAVY ION DENSITY (CM-3), HEAVY ION TEMPERATURE
                (EV), AND THREE VELOCITY COMPONENTS, (RHO, PHI,Z) IN KM/S. A
                CYLINDRICAL COORDINATE SYSTEM CENTERED ON THE PLANET IS USED,
                WITH RHO OUTWARDS FROM THE SPIN AXIS, PHI IN THE DIRECTION OF
                ROTATION, AND Z THE DISTANCE ABOVE THE EQUATOR. EACH ROW HAS THE
                FORMAT (2I4,2I3,F7.3,7E11.3). VALUES OF 1.E32 INDICATE THAT THE
                PARAMETER COULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE DATA USING THE STANDARD
                ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DATASET AND
                THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PRODUCED IT CAN BE FOUND ELSEWHERE IN THIS
                CATALOG. AN OVERVIEW OF THE DATA IN THIS DATA SET CAN BE FOUND IN
                RICHARDSON (1986) AND A COMPLETE INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION CAN BE
            FOUND IN BRIDGE (1977).</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
