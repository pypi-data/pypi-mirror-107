            <description>This data set contains archival results from gravity
                investigations conducted during the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
                (MRO) mission. Radio measurements were made using the MRO
                spacecraft and Earth-based stations of the NASA Deep Space
                Network (DSN). The data set includes high-resolution spherical
                harmonic models of Mars' gravity field generated by groups
                at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Goddard Space Flight Center,
                covariance matrices for some models, and maps for some models;
                these results were derived from raw radio tracking data. Updates
                to the archive may include derived line-of-sight acceleration
            profile.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
