            <description>This data set contains archival results from radio science
                investigations conducted during the MESSENGER mission. Radio
                measurements were made using the MESSENGER spacecraft and
                Earth-based stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The
                data set includes three products: 1) high-resolution spherical
                harmonic models of Mercury's gravity field. These results
                were derived from raw radio tracking data; 2) measurements of
                Mercury's radius at several locations around the planet.
                These radii are derived from radio occultations; and 3) spherical
                harmonic models of Mercury's surface shape. Both Mercury
                Laser Altimeter (MLA) data and occultation data were used to
                generate the shape models. The investigations were conducted by
            personnel at JHU/APL, GSFC, and JPL.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
