            <description>This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field
                intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver (PWS)
                spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Neptunian
                magnetosphere. For each 4-second interval, a field strength is
                determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose
                center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and
                which are logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per
                decade. The time associated with each set of intensities (16
                channels) is the time of the beginning of the scan. During data
                gaps where complete 4-second spectra are missing, no entries
                exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or
                tagged in any other way. When one or more channels are missing
                within a scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are
                edited but not calibrated. The data numbers in this data set can
                be plotted in raw form for event searches and simple trend
                analysis since they are roughly proportional to the log of the
                electric field strength. Calibration procedures and tables are
            provided for use with this data set</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
