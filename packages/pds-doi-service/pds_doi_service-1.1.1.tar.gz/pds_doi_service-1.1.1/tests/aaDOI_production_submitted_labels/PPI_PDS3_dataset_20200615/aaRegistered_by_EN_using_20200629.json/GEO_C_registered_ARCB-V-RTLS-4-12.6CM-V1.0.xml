            <description>The Arecibo 12.6 cm radar data set for Venus consists of scaled
                radar backscatter cross section images generated from data
                obtained in 1983 and 1988. The images are in raster format (one
                image per record, with no embedded labels). The original images
                are in 16-bit, unsigned integer, most-significant-byte-first
                format. Since the volume of the entire set of 16-bit images would
                have exceeded the capacity of the CD-ROM, some of the images have
                been scaled to 8-bit versions. Specifically, the entire set of
                1988 images are in the scaled 8-bit format, while all the 1983
                images are in the original 16-bit format. Both the 16-bit and the
            8-bit images were provided by Don Campbell, Cornell University.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
