            <description>This digital image map of Mars is a cartographic extension of a
                previously released set of CD volumes containing individual
                Viking Orbiter Images (PDS volumes VO_1001, VO_1002, etc.). The
                data in the latter are pristine, in the sense that they were
                processed only to the extent required to view them as images.
                They contain the artifacts and the radiometric, geometric, and
                photometric characteristics of the raw data transmitted by the
                spacecraft. This new volume set, on the other hand, contains
                cartographic compilations made by processing the raw images to
                reduce radiometric and geometric distortions and to form
                geodetically controlled Mosaicked Digital Image Models (MDIMs).
                (Because the photometric processing used in this MDIM was
                oversimplified, quantitative radiometric analysis on this data is
                not possible.) It also contains digitized versions of an
                airbrushed map of Mars as well as a listing of all IAU-approved
            feature names.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
