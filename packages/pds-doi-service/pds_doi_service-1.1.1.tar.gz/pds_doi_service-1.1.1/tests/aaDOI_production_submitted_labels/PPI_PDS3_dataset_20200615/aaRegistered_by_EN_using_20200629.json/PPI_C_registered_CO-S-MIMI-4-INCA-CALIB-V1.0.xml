            <description>The Ion and Neutral Camera (INCA) obtains remote images of the global
                distribution of energetic ions for energies from 7 keV/nucleon to 8
                MeV/nucleon, discriminated according to energy and mass species
                (oxygen and hydrogen). To obtain the images, INCA measures the arrival
                directions, energy and mass species of Energetic Neutral Atoms (ENA's)
                using the relatively new technique of ENA imaging. INCA also can be
                commanded to obtain very high sensitivity ion measurements, providing
                the angular, energy and species distributions of in-situ O and H ions.
                
                The Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument(MIMI) Imaging Neutral
                Camera (INCA) calibrated data set includes all image data collected
                from the MIMI Data Processing Unit during the Saturn tour. The
                original data has been decommutated, decoded, calibrated and further
                processed by software at the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL).
                
                The calibrated image data is provided in three forms: an averaged
                form where the original image N x N pixel images pixels intensity are
                averaged to a single value for one species and time-of-flight (TOF)
                combination, browse images which display rows and columns of images
                for one species and TOF combination, and movies which display
                averaged ENA image skymaps.
                
                Calibration of INCA data has been described fully in the
                Cassini/MIMI Data User Guide.  [VANDEGRIFFETAL2012]
                
                This data set should be among the first used by a user of any of the
                MIMI INCA archive as it will lead one to information required to
                search for more detailed or highly specialized features in the
            original data.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
