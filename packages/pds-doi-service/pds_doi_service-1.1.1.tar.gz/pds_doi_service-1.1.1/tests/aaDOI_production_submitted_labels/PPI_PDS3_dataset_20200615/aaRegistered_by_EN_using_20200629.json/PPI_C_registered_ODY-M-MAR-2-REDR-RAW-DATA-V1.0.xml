            <description>The MARIE (Martian Radiation Environment Experiment), aboard the
                2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft, was launched on April 7, 2001, and
                arrived at Mars on October 24, 2001. Data were collected
                intermittently during the cruise phase, starting in late April
                and ending in late July. A problem with MARIE's onboard
                computer occurred in early August, and the instrument was turned
                off until early March, 2002, after Odyssey's mapping orbit
                had been established. Data have been collected from that time to
                the present without major interruption. Routine minor
                interruptions of up to 48 hours have occurred during the orbital
                phase when the instrument's data is erased from local
                storage (after having been downloaded). MARIE is oriented to
                point in the direction opposite Odyssey's velocity vector.
                Space radiation is for the most part isotropic, so the
                orientation of Odyssey is usually not critical and references to
                external coordinate systems are not a part of the data returned
                by MARIE. There is one exception to the statement that space
                radiation is isotropic: During the early stages of solar particle
            events, there can be directionality in the particle flux.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
