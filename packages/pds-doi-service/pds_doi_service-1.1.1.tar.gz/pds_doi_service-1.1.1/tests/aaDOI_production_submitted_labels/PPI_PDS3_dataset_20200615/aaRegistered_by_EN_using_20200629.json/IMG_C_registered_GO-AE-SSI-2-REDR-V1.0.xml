            <description>This data set has been generated by NASA's Galileo Project
                in order to distribute the images acquired by the Solid State
                Imaging (SSI) camera to the scientists and later to the Planetary
                Data System (PDS). The collection resides on volumes GO_0007 thru
                GO_0015 and consists of all images acquired by the Galileo
                spacecraft during the Gaspra and the second encounter with the
                Earth (Earth2). Included are images of Gaspra, the Earth's
                Moon and the Earth taken during the 1991 and 1992 encounters
                (SCLK 99757945 through 166324700), as well as additional star and
            calibration data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
