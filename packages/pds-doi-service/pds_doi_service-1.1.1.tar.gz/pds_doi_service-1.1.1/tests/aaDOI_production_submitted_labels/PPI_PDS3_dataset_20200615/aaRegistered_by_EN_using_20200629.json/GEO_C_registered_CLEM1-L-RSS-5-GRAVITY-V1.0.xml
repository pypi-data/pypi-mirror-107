            <description>The gravitational signature of the Moon was determined from
                velocity perturbations of the Clementine spacecraft as measured
                from the Doppler shift of the S-band radio tracking signal.
                Clementine was tracked by NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) at
                Goldstone, California, Canberra, Australia, Madrid, Spain, as
                well as by the Pomonkey, Maryland, tracking station operated by
                the Naval Research Laboratory. The tracking data were used to
                determine the Clementine orbit about the Moon, as well as the
                lunar gravity field [ZUBERETAL1994]. A detailed description of
                how the Clementine orbits were computed and an assessment of
            their quality can be found in [LEMOINEETAL1995B].</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
