            <description>This dataset contains CRISM Multispectral Reduced Data Records
                (MRDRs). MRDRs are organized into 30 subdirectories named by the
                Mars Chart containing the MRDR, e.g. MC01. Latitude and longitude
                limits of Mars Charts are given below. An MRDR consists of
                several or more strips of multispectral survey data mosaicked
                into a map tile. Thus a map tile is constructed from a large
                number of TRDRs. The mosaic is uncontrolled (accepting existing
                pointing data often resulting in image mismatch at seams within a
                mosaic). The tile contains up to four images: radiance extracted
                from temporary TRDRs Lambert albedo summary products DDR data
                used to generate the first three images, augmented with
                additional positional information The MRDR also contains up to
                two text files, one listing the wavelengths present and ther
                other listing the SPICE metakernels used for map projection of
                each constituent observation on the tile. Each file has a
                separate label. For every latitude or longitude in an MRDR, there
                is a radiance and all the information providing traceability to
                through I/F to Lambert albedo corrected for atmospheric,
                photometric, and thermal emission effects, plus the information
                needed to reconstruct the map projection. A global pattern of
                1964 such tiles is being used, forming the major data product for
                multispectral survey observations. Multiple MRDRs are in each of
            the 30 subdirectories.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
