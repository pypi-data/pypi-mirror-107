            <description>This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the Lunar
                Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. The radio observations were
                carried out using the LRO spacecraft and Earth-based stations of
                the commercial Universal Space Network (USN), the Ka-band ground
                station at White Sands, New Mexico (WS1), and the Next Generation
                Satellite Laser Ranging station in Greenbelt, Maryland (NGSLR).
                Additional data were provided by the NASA Deep Space Network
                (DSN) during commissioning. Ongoing participation by the
                International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) network of stations
                provides further LR data that are processed by the Lunar Orbiter
                Laser Altimeter (LOLA) Science Operations Center (SOC). Of most
                interest are likely to be the Tracking Data Files in the TRK
            directory.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
