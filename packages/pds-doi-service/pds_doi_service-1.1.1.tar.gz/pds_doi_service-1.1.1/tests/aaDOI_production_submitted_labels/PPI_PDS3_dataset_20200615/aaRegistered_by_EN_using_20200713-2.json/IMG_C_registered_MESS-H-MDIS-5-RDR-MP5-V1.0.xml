            <description>Abstract
                ========
                The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a
                Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted
                on a common pivot platform. This dataset includes 5-Color
                Multispectral Reduced Data Records for the WAC. The 5-Color Map
                Projected Multispectral RDR (MP5) data set consists of a 5-color
                map of northern latitudes acquired during MESSENGER's Extended
                Mission, and includes I/F in the 5 filters used for this
                map. This product has higher spatial resolution than, and complements,
                an 8-color multispectral map acquired during the primary mission
                (in MDR data products). It has better spectral sampling and the
                same spatial resolution, and complements, a 3-color multispectral
                map also acquired during the Extended Mission (in MD3 data products).
                It is intended to search for spatial variations in color properties
                of the northern volcanic plains.
                
                This product is photometrically normalized to a solar incidence angle
                (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle
                (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling of 128 pixels per degree.  The
                map consists of a single tile covering the north polar quadrangle
                or 'Mercury chart' already defined by the USGS (H01), plus the
                northern parts of the 4 Mercury charts immediately to the south
                (H02-H05). The tile is composed of 5 bands corresponding to 5 of
                the 11 WAC filters.  The tile also contains 6 backplanes describing
                ancillary information. The subset of 5 of 11 available multispectral
                filters samples albedo and spectral slope over MDIS's wavelength
                range. Unlike the 3- and 8-color products, which were acquired with
                the WAC pointed near nadir, the 5-color map was acquired pointed
                at a nearly uniform phase angle near 30 degrees to minimize
            shadowing at the high latitudes of the Northern Volcanic Plains.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
