            <description>This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting gravity science data acquired during the Juno
                Jupiter orbits starting in July 2016. The radio observations were
                carried out using the Juno spacecraft and Earth-based receiving
                stations of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The data set was
                designed primarily to determine the gravitational field of Jupiter.
                Of most interest are likely to be the Orbit Data Files in the ODF
                directory, which provided the raw input to gravity investigations,
                as well as the  tropospheric media calibration file produced by
            the Advanced Media Calibration (AMC) system.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
