            <description>This data set contains archival derived science data, acquired
                from the Lunar Gravity Ranging System (LGRS) on the two
                spacecraft comprising the Gravity Recovery and Interior
                Laboratory (GRAIL) mission. Measurements were made using the
                GRAIL spacecraft and Earth-based stations of the NASA Deep Space
                Network (DSN). The data set includes high-resolution spherical
                harmonic models of the Moon's gravity field, covariance
                matrices for some models, and maps for some models. It also
                contains a complete set of SPICE SPK Files ('kernel
                files'), which can be accessed using SPICE software. The SPK
                products in this data set differ from those archived by GRAIL
                navigation, as they were created by the GRAIL SDS and make use of
                the LGRS to provide a more refined solution of the spacecraft
            ephemerides than those provided by GRAIL navigation.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
