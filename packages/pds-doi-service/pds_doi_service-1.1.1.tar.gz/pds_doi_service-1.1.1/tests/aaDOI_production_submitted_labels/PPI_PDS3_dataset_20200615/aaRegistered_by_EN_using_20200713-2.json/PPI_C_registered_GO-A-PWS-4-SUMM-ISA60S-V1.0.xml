            <description>This data set includes 1-minute averages
                of the electric and magnetic wave spectra obtained during the period that
                the Galileo plasma wave receiver was operated during the flyby of Ida.
                The parameter provided for the electric field spectrum is the electric
                field spectral density in units of V^2/m^2/Hz. The magnetic field spectrum
                is provided in units of magnetic field spectral density, nT^2/Hz.  The
                spectral information is averaged and binned into 49 logarithmically-spaced
                channels from about 6 Hz to 5.6 MHz for the electric measurements and
                34 channels from about 6 Hz to 75 kHz for the magnetic.  Note that these
                'channels' do not generally correspond to the 158 specific channels
                described in the instrument description document. The reduction in
                spectral resolution for this data set was performed in order to make the
                set more conducive to use as a browse data set.   The sources of this
                browse data set are the High Frequency Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver,
                and Spectrum Analyzer which make up the Low Rate Science portion of
            the PWS.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
