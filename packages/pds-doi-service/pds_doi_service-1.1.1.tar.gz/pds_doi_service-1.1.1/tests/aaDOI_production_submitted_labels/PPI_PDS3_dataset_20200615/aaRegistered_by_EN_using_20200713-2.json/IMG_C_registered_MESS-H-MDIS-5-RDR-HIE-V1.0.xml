            <description>Abstract
                ========
                The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists of two cameras, a Wide
                Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle Camera (NAC), mounted on a
                common pivot platform. This dataset includes Map Projected High-
                Incidence Angle Basemap Illuminated from the East RDRs (HIEs) which
                comprise a global map of I/F measured by the NAC or WAC filter 7 (both
                centered near 750 nm) during the the Extended Mission at high
                incidence angles to accentuate subtle topography, photometrically
                normalized to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission
                angle (e) = 0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial
                sampling of 256 pixels per degree. The HIE data set is a companion to
                the Map Projected High-Incidence Angle Basemap Illluminated from the
                West RDR (HIW) data set. Together the two data sets are intended to
                detect and allow the mapping of subtle topography. They complement a
                Basemap Data Record (BDR) data set also composed of WAC filter 7 and
                NAC images acquired at moderate/high solar incidence angles centered
                near 68 degrees (changed to 74 degrees in the final end-of-mission
                data delivery), and a Low Incidence Angle (LOI) data set also
                composed of WAC filter 7 and NAC images acquired at lower incidence
                centered near 45 degrees, analogous to the geometry used for color
                imaging.
                
                The map is divided into 54 'tiles', each representing the NW, NE,
                SW, or SE quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar
                quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the USGS. Each tile
                also contains 5 backplanes: observation ID; BDR metric, a metric used
                to determine the stacking order of component images, modified for the
                higher incidence angle centered near 78 degrees; solar incidence
            angle; emission angle; and phase angle.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
