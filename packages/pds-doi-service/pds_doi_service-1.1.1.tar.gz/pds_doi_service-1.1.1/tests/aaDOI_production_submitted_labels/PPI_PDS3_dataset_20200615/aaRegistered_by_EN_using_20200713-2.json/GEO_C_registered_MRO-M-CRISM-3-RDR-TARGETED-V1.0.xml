            <description>This dataset is intended to include IR and VNIR data from the
                CRISM instrument on MRO, processed to several different levels.
                The core structure parallels that of an EDR with a multiband
                image and a text file containing frame-specific housekeeping
                information for each of the concatenated image frames in the
                multiband image. However the image data has been converted to
                units of radiance using level-4 and level-6 CDRs, and analog
                housekeeping items in the text file (voltages, currents, and
                temperatures) have been converted into physical units using a
                level-6 CDR. Both files share a common label. A TRDR may also
                contain separately labeled multiband images in which radiance has
                been processed to I/F (radiance divided by (pi * solar flux at 1
                AU * heliocentric distance^2)), Lambert albedo, or a set of
                derived spectral parameters (summary products) that provide an
                overview of the data set. The summary products include Lambert
                albedo at key wavelengths, or key band depths or spectral
                reflectance ratios. To create Lambert albedo or most summary
                products, estimated corrections for atmospheric and photometric
            effects are applied to the I/F data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
