            <description>This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy
                Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft
                for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet
                Neptune.  The period covered is 1989-08-24T00:00:00.000 SCET  to
                1989-08-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series
                of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available
                from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because
                the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the
                nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,
                and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.
                With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged
                for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are
                time averaged over an arbitrary period (12 or 24 sec, see below)
            for the periods when the detectors are stationary.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
