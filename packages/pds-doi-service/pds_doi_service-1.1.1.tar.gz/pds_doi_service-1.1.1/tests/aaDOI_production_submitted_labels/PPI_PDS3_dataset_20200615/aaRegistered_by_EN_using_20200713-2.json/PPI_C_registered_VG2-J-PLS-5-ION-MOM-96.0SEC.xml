            <description>THIS DATA SET CONTAINS THE BEST ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL ION
                DENSITY FROM VOYAGER 2 AT JUPITER IN THE PLS VOLTAGE RANGE
                (10-5950 EV/Q). IT IS CALCULATED USING THE METHOD OF MCNUTT ET
                AL. (1981) WHICH TO FIRST ORDER CONSISTS OF TAKING THE TOTAL
                MEASURED CURRENT AND DIVIDING BY THE COLLECTOR AREA AND PLASMA
                BULK VELOCITY. THIS METHOD IS ONLY ACCURATE FOR HIGH MACH NUMBER
                FLOWS DIRECTLY INTO THE DETECTOR, AND MAY RESULT IN
                UNDERESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL DENSITY OF A FACTOR OF 2 IN THE OUTER
                MAGNETOSPHERE. THUS ABSOLUTE DENSITIES SHOULD BE TREATED WITH
                CAUTION, BUT DENSITY VARIATIONS IN THE DATA SET CAN BE TRUSTED.
                THE LOW RESOLUTION MODE DENSITY IS USED AT ALL TIMES EXCEPT DAY
                190 2100-2200 WHEN THE LARGER OF THE HIGH AND LOW RESOLUTION MODE
                DENSITIES IN A 96 SEC PERIOD IS USED. COROTATION IS ASSUMED
                INSIDE L=17.5, AND A CONSTANT VELOCITY COMPONENT OF 200 KM/S INTO
                THE D CUP IS USED OUTSIDE OF THIS. THESE ARE THE DENSITIES GIVEN
                IN THE MCNUTT ET AL. (1981) PAPER CORRECTED BY A FACTOR OF 1.209
                (.9617) FOR DENSITIES OBTAINED FROM THE SIDE (MAIN) SENSOR. THIS
                CORRECTION IS DUE TO A BETTER CALCULATION OF THE EFFECTIVE AREA
                OF THE SENSORS. DATA FORMAT: COLUMNS 1-6 ARE TIME (YEAR, DAY,
                HOUR, MIN, SEC, MSEC) COLUMN 7 IS THE MOMENT DENSITY IN CM-3.
                EACH ROW HAS FORMAT (6I4, E12.3). VALUES OF 1.E32 INDICATE THAT
                THE PARAMETER COULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE DATA USING THE
                STANDARD ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THIS
                DATASET AND THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PRODUCED IT CAN BE FOUND
                ELSEWHERE IN THIS CATALOG. AN OVERVIEW OF THE DATA IN THIS DATA
                SET CAN BE FOUND IN MCNUTT ET AL. (1981) AND A COMPLETE
            INSTRUMENT DESCRIPTION CAN BE FOUND IN BRIDGE (1977).</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
