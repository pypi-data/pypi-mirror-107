            <description>This data set consists of optical depth measurements made using
                the the Reagan Radiometer (acquired data in July 17 and September
                29, 1989 at Lunar Lake). Total instantaneous optical depth was
                obtained from the data through use of Beer's Law, as
                follows. The set of observations for one channel are plotted as
                natural logarithm of instrument voltage versus secant of
                incidence angle (i.e., Langley Plot). This allows one to solve
                for the equivalent instrument voltage that would be obtained
                above the atmosphere (the plot intercept) and the optical depth
                (the plot slope). Instantaneous optical depths were then derived
                by using this intercept and solving for optical depth using pairs
            of voltage values acquired close together in time.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
