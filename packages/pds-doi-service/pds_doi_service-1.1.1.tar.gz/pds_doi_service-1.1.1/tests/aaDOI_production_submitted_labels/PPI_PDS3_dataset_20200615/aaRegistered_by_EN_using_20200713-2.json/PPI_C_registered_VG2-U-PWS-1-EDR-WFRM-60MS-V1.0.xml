            <description>This data set consists of
                electric field waveform samples from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave
                Receiver waveform receiver obtained during the Uranus encounter.
                The waveforms are collections of 4-bit samples of the electric
                field measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800
                samples per second.  1600 samples are collected in 55.56 msec
                followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval constitutes a
                line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271 frames of
                waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each.  The
                telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for
                images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing
                the form of the data.  The waveform is sampled through a bandpass
                filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  The 4-bit samples
                provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a
                linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary
                because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform
                receiver.  The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4
                bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows
                the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum
                level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain
                control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver
            is about 100 db.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
