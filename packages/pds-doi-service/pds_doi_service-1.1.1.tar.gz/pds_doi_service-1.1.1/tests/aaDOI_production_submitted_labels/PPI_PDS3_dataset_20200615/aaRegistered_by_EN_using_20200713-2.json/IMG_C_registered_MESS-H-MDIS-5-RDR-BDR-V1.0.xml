            <description>Abstract ======== The Mercury Dual Imaging System (MDIS) consists
                of two cameras, a Wide Angle Camera (WAC) and a Narrow Angle
                Camera (NAC), mounted on a common pivot platform. This dataset
                includes the Basemap Reduced Data Records. The Map Projected
                Basemap RDR (BDR) data set consists of a global map of I/F
                measured by the NAC or in WAC filter 7 (both centered near 750
                nm) at moderate/high incidence angle, photometrically normalized
                to a solar incidence angle (i) = 30 degrees, emission angle (e) =
                0 degrees, and phase angle (g) = 30 degrees at a spatial sampling
                of 256 pixels per degree. The map is divided into 54 segments or
                'tiles', each representing the NW, NE, SW, or SE
                quadrant of one of the 13 non-polar or one of the 2 polar
                quadrangles or 'Mercury charts' already defined by the
                USGS. Each tile also contains 5 backplanes: observation id for
                each included image; BDR metric, used to determine the stacking
                order of component images; solar incidence angle; emission angle;
            and phase angle.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
