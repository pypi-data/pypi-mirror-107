            <description>Line of Sight Acceleration Profile Data Records (LOSAPDR) consist
                of data from Doppler tracking of the orbiting spacecraft. The
                relative motion of the spacecraft and the earth-based radio
                receiver is measured very precisely, and known motions are
                removed a priori (i.e. earth rotation, planetary motions,
                spacecraft orbital motion, solar pressure, drag), leaving small
                velocity changes caused by variations in the mass distribution of
                the planet. The residual Doppler frequency shifts are linearly
                proportional to the component of velocity in the Earth direction.
                Numerical differentiation of these velocity residuals with
                respect to time produces line-of-sight (LOS) gravity. These
                measures are accelerations at spacecraft altitude which can be
                modeled for geophysical interpretation. For information on Lunar
                Prospector (LP) gravity investigations see [KONOPLIVETAL1998

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
