            <description>The Juno Ultraviolet Spectrograph (UVS) CODMAC Level 3 Reduced Data Record is
                a collection of the far ultraviolet photon detections obtained by the UVS
                instrument, corrected for instrumental effects, radiometrically calibrated,
                and correlated with the auxiliary information needed to locate the
                observations in space and time.  These data are organized, in a manner very
                similar to the RDR product files from which they are derived, into extensions
                within files formatted according to the Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
                standard, version 2.1b.  The UVS RDR archive enables reprocessing of the
                corrected and calibrated science data into far ultraviolet map products as map
                processing routines improve. Investigators interested in applying advanced
                mapping methods or needing to understand the properties of the corrected and
                calibrated data will find the RDR products useful.  Many investigators,
                however, will be interested in using the UVS CODMAC Level 5 far ultraviolet
            map products directly.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
