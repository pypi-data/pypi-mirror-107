            <description>This data set contains the Infrared Thermal Mapping (IRTM) data
                of Mars acquired by the Viking orbiters. The database contains
                the time, geometry, and radiative parameters obtained by the IRTM
                instrument. Included in the database for each measurement are
                model temperatures of Mars represent the average Martian response
                to the temporal variation of insolation. The reference
                'Thermal and Albedo Mapping of Mars during the Viking
                Primary Mission', Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 82,
                No. 28, 1977, describes how the thermal emission and reflected
                energy measured by the various channels on the Infrared Thermal
                Mapper are used to reveal wide variations in the Martian surface
                properties. There is a description of how the surface thermal
                inertias are mapped and correlated with the surficial geologic
                units. The derivation of model and surface temperatures are
                described. The data set includes latitude and longitude for each
                measured point, as well as emission angle, solar incidence angle,
                the position of the sun, and other parameters that help to locate
                the position of the spacecraft relative to Mars. (For further
            information see the Confidence_Level_Note).</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
