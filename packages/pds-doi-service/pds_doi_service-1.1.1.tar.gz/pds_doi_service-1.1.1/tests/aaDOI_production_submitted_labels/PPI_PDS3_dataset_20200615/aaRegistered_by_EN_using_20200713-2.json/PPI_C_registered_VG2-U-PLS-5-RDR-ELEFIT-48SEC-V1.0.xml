            <description>This data set contains electron
                parameters in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV) at Uranus during the
                Voyager 2 encounter. Parameters are calculated in several ways. Total
                moment density and temperature are given. Each electron spectrum is
                also fit with a thermal component and 1-3 hot components depending on
                how many Maxwellians are needed to fit the entire distribution. The
                moment density and temperature of the hot component is calculated
                after the thermal component is subtracted from the spectrum. The
                CHI-Square value for each fit is given. The spacecraft charge is not
                calculated consistently, and may result in factor of 2-3 errors in the
                thermal electron density. Data is unreliable inside 5 RU and in the
                occultation regions. At Uranus measurements were taken using both a
                long and a short integration time. Each 48 SEC measurement frame
                contained either an E1-Short and an E2-Long measurement or an
                E2-Short and an EI-Long. To reduce systematic errors,  complete
                electron spectra were obtained only by combining two long or two short
                spectra. The instrument threshold is at a density of about 0.001
                CM-3; thus fits which yield data close to this value should be treated
                with caution.  Flags in the data indicate whether the full analysis
                could be performed and if the data was contaminated by LECP stepping.
            A complete description of this data set is in Sittler et al. (1987).</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
