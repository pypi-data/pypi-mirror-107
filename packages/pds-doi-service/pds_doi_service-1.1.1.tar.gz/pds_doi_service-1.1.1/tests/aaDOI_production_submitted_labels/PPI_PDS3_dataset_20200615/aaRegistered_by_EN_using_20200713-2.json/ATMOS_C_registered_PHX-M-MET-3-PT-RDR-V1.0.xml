            <description>The PHX METEOROLOGICAL DATA product contains calibrated
                temperature and pressure data. The temperature data was collected
                at 250, 500 and 1000mm above the Phoenix Lander deck, and the
                pressure data was collected at (nearly) the height of the Lander
                deck. Nominally the data was collected at 2 sec resolution, but
                is also provided at 512 sec averages (with distribution
                statistics). Owing to the placement of a heater near the pressure
                sensor, a corrected set of values was required, and is provided
            for the pressure data.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
