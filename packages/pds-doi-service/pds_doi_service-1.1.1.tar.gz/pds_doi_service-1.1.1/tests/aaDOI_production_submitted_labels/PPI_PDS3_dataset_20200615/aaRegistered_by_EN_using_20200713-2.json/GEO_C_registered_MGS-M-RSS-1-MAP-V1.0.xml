            <description>This data set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the
                Mapping (MAP) phase of the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) mission.
                The radio observations were carried out using the MGS spacecraft
                and Earth-based receiving stations of the NASA Deep Space Network
                (DSN). The observations were designed to test the spacecraft
                radio system, the DSN ground system, and MGS operations
                procedures; to be used in generating high-resolution gravity
                field models of Mars; and for estimating density and structure of
                the Mars atmosphere. A small number of surface scattering
                experiments were also conducted. Of most interest are likely to
                be the Orbit Data File and Original Data Record files, in the ODF
                and ODR directories, respectively, which provided the raw input
                to gravity and atmospheric investigations. The MAP phase extended
                from March 1999 through January 2001. Data were organized in
                approximately chronological order and delivered on a set of 184
                CD volumes at the rate of 2-3 CD's per week. Typical volume
                of a one-day ODF was 300-400 kB. Typical volume of an ODR was
                5-10 MB, and there were typically 8-16 ODR's per day
            depending on DSN schedules and observing geometry.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
