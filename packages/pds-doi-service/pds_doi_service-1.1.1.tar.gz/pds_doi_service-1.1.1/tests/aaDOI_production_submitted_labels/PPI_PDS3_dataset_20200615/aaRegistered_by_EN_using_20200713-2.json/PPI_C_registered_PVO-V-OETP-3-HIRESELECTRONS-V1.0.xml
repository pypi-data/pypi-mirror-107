            <description>The High Resolution Ne File. These data
                are based on measurements of the electron saturation current or the ion
                saturation current taken from as many voltampere curves as the telemetry
                data rate permitted. Since Ne is assumed equal to Ni everywhere in the
                ionosphere, either can be used as a measure of Ne. The ion current is
                used at high densities (Ni &gt; 4x104cm-3) and the electron current is used
                at lower densities. Typically, 4 to 8 high resolution density samples are
                obtained in the interval between recovered voltampere curves, although
                this ratio is bit rate dependent. This provides Ne and Ni measurements at
                much smaller intervals than is possible from the voltampere curves
                themselves. High resolution measurements are typically available at 2 to
                8 second intervals depending upon the telemetry rate available to the
            OETP at the time.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
