            <description>2004-02-27 RS:simpson added2004-03-01 RS:simpson revisedThis data
                set contains archival raw, partially processed, and
                ancillary/supporting radio science data acquired during the 2001
                Mars Odyssey (ODY) mission. The radio observations were carried
                out using the ODY spacecraft and Earth-based receiving stations
                of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN). The observations were
                designed to test the spacecraft radio system, the DSN ground
                system, and ODY operations procedures and to be used in
                reconstructing the spacecraft orbit, generating high-resolution
                gravity field models of Mars, and determining the nature of the
                near-Sun solar plasma. Of most interest are likely to be the
                Orbit Data Files in the ODF directory and the ionospheric and
                tropospheric media calibration files in the ION and TRO
                directories, respectively. The first ODF in the data set begins
                on 2002-01-06, which was actually in the late stages of the
                Aerobraking Phase and just before periapsis was lowered for about
                2 weeks to about 200 km; the Mapping altitude was about 400 km.
                Data were delivered to PDS in approximately chronological order
                at the rate of 1-3 CD-WO volumes per month, of which about 0.01
                GB/month were ODF's. By volume, the largest data type was
                either the Archival Tracking Data File (TDF; until early 2003) or
                the Tracking and Navigation File (TNF; beginning early 2003),
            both of which served as parents of the ODF.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
