            <description>This data set contains plasma parameters
                from the Voyager 2 inbound magnetosheath and outbound data from the
                magnetotail through the solar wind. Inbound Voyager 2 passed near noon
                local time, so it sampled regions of the magnetosheath where flow is
                generally subsonic. Distribution functions observed were well represented
                by two convected isotropic proton Maxwellians, so this type of
                distribution was used to derive the proton velocity, density and
                temperature. Physically the two populations represent the thermal plasma
                accelerated at the shock (the colder component) and ions reflected once at
                the shock before entering the magnetosheath (the hotter component). The
                PLS experiment could not resolve alpha particles in this region so no
                alpha parameters are provided; the neglect of alpha made cause an
                overestimate of the hot proton component of the plasma. One sigma errors
            are provided for the fit parameters.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
