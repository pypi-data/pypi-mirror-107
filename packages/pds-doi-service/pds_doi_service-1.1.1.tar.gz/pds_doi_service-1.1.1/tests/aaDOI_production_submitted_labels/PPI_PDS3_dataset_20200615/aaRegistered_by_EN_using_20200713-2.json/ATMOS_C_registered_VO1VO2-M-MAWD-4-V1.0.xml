            <description>This data set consists of the raster-averaged radiant intensities
                and associated data parameters produced from data acquired by the
                Mars Atmospheric Water Detectors (MAWD) onboard the Viking
                Orbiters. The basic observations give temporal coverage spanning
                just over two martian years and variable, but extensive, spatial
                coverage of the planet. MAWD was a five-channel grating
                spectrometer measuring solar radiation reflected from the surface
                and atmosphere of Mars in and out of water vapor bands in the 1.4
                micrometer spectral interval. The data set described here
                contains the solar reflected radiant intensities (i.e.,
                radiances) measured by MAWD, derived water vapor column
                abundances, a derived '1.4-micrometer brightness', and
                ancillary data (e.g., viewing geometry, surface elevation and air
                mass). Column water vapor abundances were derived by comparing
                the reflected radiant intensities in three water vapor absorption
                bands to radiant intensities in the two interspersed continua
                observed air mass and then normalized by the air mass to obtain a
                vertical column abundance. A basic description of the instrument,
                its observational modes and its derived data products is given in
                [FARMER_ETAL_1977]. A description of the global and seasonal
                variation of water vapor on Mars, based on the complete MAWD
                observational record, is given in [JAKOSKY_FARMER_1982]. This
                data set was generated from the raster-level data base
                constructed during the Viking Mission on the original data
                processing system (IRPS: Infrared Processing System) by the MAWD
                Science Team, led by C. B. Farmer, JPL. Together with the
                instantaneous field of view (IFOV) radiances and geometry, the
                raster-level radiances, associated water column abundances and
                ancillary data have been archived at the NSSDC (NSSDC id
                75-075A-03A, 75-083A-03A). Data from the final phase of the VO-1
                mission were added, supervised by R. Zurek, JPL. Eventually, the
                data set was restructured, additional quality flags were
                introduced, and a second estimate of the water vapor column
                abundance (WFAPT, termed COLUMN_H2O_A in the data set) was added
                [by R. Zurek, JPL [JAKOSKY_ETAL_1988].]. The data base was
                restructured, while preserving key unique parameters, into a
                consistent format with the Viking Orbiter Infrared Thermal Mapper
                (IRTM) data [R. Mehlman, R. Zurek]. Both the MAWD and IRTM data
                sets were then accessible with the XXFUNC package. Further
                quality checking of the MAWD data was carried out by B. Jakosky,
            U. Colorado.</description>

            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
