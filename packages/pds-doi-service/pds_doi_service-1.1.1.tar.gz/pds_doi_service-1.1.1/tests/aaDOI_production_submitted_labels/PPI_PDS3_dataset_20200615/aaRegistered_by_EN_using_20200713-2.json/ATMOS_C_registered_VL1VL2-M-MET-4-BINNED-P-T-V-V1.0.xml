            <description>This data set contains binned and splined data obtained from the
                Viking Meteorology Instrument System (VMIS) through most of the
                Viking Lander 2 mission and the early days of the Lander 1
                mission. The data set consists of mean values of pressure,
                temperature, and wind speed (zonal, meridional, and combined) and
                relevant statistics and warning flags calculated for 25 bins of
                equal duration per day. The effect of Lander interference on the
                temperature measurements is also estimated. The data are
                presented on a bin by bin basis for Lander 1 sol (Mars solar day
                after landing) 1-45 and for Lander 2 sol 1-1050 (with the only
                major gap occurring between sol 561 and 625). Failure of the
                quadrant sensor on Lander 1 sol 45 (see HESS_ETAL_1977) precludes
                unambiguous determination of wind direction without modification
                to the analysis techniques and software used to generate this
                data set (see HESS_ETAL_1977) therefore, this data set does not
                include Lander 1 measurements made after sol 45. A data set which
                has recovered a period of measurements made between Lander 1 sol
                1 and 350 is available refer to PDS data set id
            VL1-M-MET-4-BINNED-P-T-V-CORR-V1.0.</description>

            <!-- Collection definition:
            a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects.
            A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
            retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
            the overall group of items.
