          Magnetometer data in the solar wind are given in Heliographic

          The dataset consists of the following columns:                      
           1) ctime (decimal seconds since 1966-01-01T00:00:00.000),          
           2) pdstime (ISO standard time format),

           6) magnetometer id (1 = LFM, 2 = HFM),

          10) Bmag  (magnitude of the average components),                    
          11) avg_Bmag (average of the magnitude of the raw components),

          14-16) rms vector (Pythagorean root mean square deviation

          18) flag a character string which indicates software or             
              s/c hardware intervention which reduces confidence              
              in the data (NULL flags represent 'good' data).

          system that rotates with Uranus with a period of                    
          17.24 hours. The system components are:                             
          R     - Radial along the Uranus-S/C line, positive away from Uranus,
          Phi   - east longitudinal component,                                
          Theta - colatitudinal component.

          or by spacecraft interference ( a flag value of 1 indicates

          been evaluated or is good). Some records that are obviously         
          contaminated have not been flagged. The hourly summary data
