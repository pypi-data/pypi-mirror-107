      The average magnetic field strength produced by the spacecraft at the   
      location of the outboard magnetometer of the dual magnetometers system  
      on V2 varies between 0.1 - 0.2 nT, comparable to the most probable      
      magnetic field strength in the inner heliosheath and significantly      
      larger than the most probable magnetic field strength in the distant    
      supersonic solar wind. The spacecraft magnetic field is a complex,      
      time-dependent signal that must be removed from the measured magnetic   
      field signal in order to derive the ambient magnetic fields of the      
      solar wind and heliosheath.  Corrections must also be made for spurious 
      magnetic signals and noise associated with the telemetry system, ground 
      tracking systems, and other factors. A non-periodic modulation of the   
      spacecraft's magnetic field, with amplitudes comparable to the average  
      ambient magnetic field strength and periods in the range from 1 to      
      12 hours, has been present approximately half the time in the V2 data   
      since ~1990, beginning in ~1985.  Finally, a spacecraft systems command 
      during late 2006 had the unintended consequence of exposing the sensors 
      to temperatures well beyond their design limits for more than one week. 
      This command also rotated one set of dual triaxial sensors through a    
      large angle and produced additional noise, drifts and spurious signals  
      as a result of damage to the sensor assembly. Extracting the signal     
      describing the solar wind and heliosheath from the many sources of      
      uncertainty is a complex and partly subjective process that requires    
      understanding of the instrument and judgment based on experience in     
      dealing with the ever-changing extraneous signals. We estimate that     
      the 1-sigma uncertainty in the 48 sec averages in the components of     
      the magnetic field is typically ~ +/-0.03 nT. The uncertainties in      
      F1, BR, BT, and BN can differ from one another and they may vary with   
      time, but there is no practical way to determine these uncertainties    
      more precisely at present."

      The high resolution data submitted to the NSSDC has its origins in the  
      original MVS 'Summary' data sets formally produced on the NSSC IBM MVS  
      mainframe system.  The original data sets contain a mix of engineering, 
      electron, magnetic field and plasma data.  The Voyager magnetometer     
      (MAG) experiment now resides on a dedicated workstation where only MAG  
      data are processed.                                                     
                                                                              
      All Voyager MAG data submitted to the NSSDC consists wholly of high     
      resolution LFM averages.  These files consist of a set of averages      
      applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  
      case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           
      1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   
      are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created
      from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   
      9.6 second averages.                                                    
                                                                              
      All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  
      coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      
      components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  
      been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager 
      magnetometer data.                                                      
                                                                              
    Coordinate System                                                         
    =================                                                         
                                                                              
      Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         
      coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   
      and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            
                                                                              
      The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   
      The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  
      orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    
      northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in 
      the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   
      plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      
      ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  
      drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         
                                                                              
      Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    
      Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     
      defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      
      system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    
      orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   
      points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the 
      solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane
      too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.
