    The data set includes both high sensitivity (C1) and low                  
    sensitivity (C2) count rates collected during the tour. The count         
    rates are reported as total counts per integration period. The            
    integration period, at full telemetry rate, is 31 ms with samples         
    collected at a 34 ms cadence. When telemetry bandwidth is limited,        
    measurements are accumulated by the instrument software prior to          
    construction of the telemetry packet. In this case the integration        
    period is equal to the number of measurements accumulated to form         
    the telemetry packet times the basic 31 ms integration period.

    The data in this data set is minimally processed. The counter sums        
    are extracted from the instrument telemetry and the values of the         
    included ancillary data are computed. The ancillary data comes            
    from a number of sources including instrument science telemetry,          
    instrument housekeeping telemetry, instrument command tables,             
    spacecraft attitude and ephemerides of the spacecraft and                 
    planetary body and moons.

    Position, velocity and orientation information contained in this          
    data set is provided with respect to a number of coordinate               
    systems.  Saturn relative information expressed in the IAU Saturn         
    frame is always included. When the spacecraft is within one hour          
    of a targeted flyby, target relative position, velocity and               
    orientation information is provided expressed in the target's IAU         
    frame. The spacecraft velocity with respect to a target body,             
    expressed in the spacecraft body frame is also included within one        
    hour of a targeted flyby.                                                 
                                                                              
    The IAU frames are centered at the center of the reference body,          
    Saturn, Titan, or another object of interest. They are rotating           
    coordinate frames which, in the case of Saturn, rotates with the          
    magnetic field.  For other bodies, the frame rotates with the             
    surface. Definitions of the coordinate frames may be found in 'The

    PRIOR TO SOI                                                              
    ------------                                                              
      Prior to SOI the INMS instrument was evacuated and the aperture         
      was closed by a cover installed prior to launch. The instrument         
      was operated during in-flight check-outs (ICO) collecting               
      baseline calibration data. During the approach science phase,           
      INMS was operated nearly continuously to obtain operational             
      experience and to validate data collection tables.                      
                                                                              
      The INMS cover was jettisoned immediately after SOI, permitting         
      measurements of the ion and neutral constituents.                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
    POST SOI                                                                  
    -------                                                                   
      INMS science data collection began at SOI. From SOI onwards, the        
      instrument was essentially in continuous operation.  Until a software   
      patch was installed during S16, the instrument processor would          
      unexpectedly reset, causing a loss of science data to occur until       
      the flight software was re-loaded. These occurrences are noted below.   
                                                                              
      An issue with velocity compensation exists from launch through          
      2005-058 which results in differences between the flight                
      software computed quad lens bias voltages and ground computed           
      values for the same velocity. This issue results in signal level        
      changes when switching between velocity compensated scans and           
      energy scans with ground computed quad lens voltages. The issue         
      is resolved in data collected after TBS-DATE by correcting the          
      ground computation of lens bias voltages.                               
                                                                              
      Prior to 2005-058 the flight software velocity compensation             
      algorithm clipped only the lens voltage that reached its limit,         
      allowing the other three voltages to be adjusted. This resulted         
      in the voltages failing to maintain their proper relationships.         
      This was corrected by insuring that once one voltage reached its        
      limit, all four voltages were frozen.                                   
                                                                              
      The spacecraft background sequence was halted just after SOI,           
      during this period, from day 2004-186 through 2004-194 no L1A           
      data was produced.                                                      
                                                                              
      Flight software checkout was performed between 2004-252T19:25:00.044    
      and 2004-255T19;10:10.044 and as a result no L1A data was               
      produced.                                                               
                                                                              
      No L1A data was produced on days 2004-309 and 2004-310 due to an        
      interrupted flight software load.                                       
                                                                              
      During S5, one unexpected processor reset occurred at                   
      2004-310T10:03:45, with a data loss until 2004-311T00:00:00             
                                                                              
      No L1A data was produced during the Probe mission from 2005-007         
      through 2005-014 and the period following from 2005-015 through         
      2005-022 while the solid state recorder was being protected until       
      the the Probe mission data was validated.                               
                                                                              
      During S10, one unexpected processor reset occurred at                  
      2005-105T17:32:07. No science data was collected from that instant      
      until the next planned reset at 2005-106T07:00:00.                      
                                                                              
      During S11, three unexpected processor resets occurred at               
      2005-135T05:10:27, 2005-139T13:15:44 and 2005-148T02:46:22. No          
      science data was collected from between the unexpected processor        
      resets and the following planned resets. As a result no science data    
      was collected from 2005-135T05:10 through 2005-163T23:59:59 except      
      for short periods following each of the planned resets.                 
                                                                              
      During S15 there was one unexpected processor reset, which occurred     
      at 2005-289T17:06:55. No science data was collected from between the    
      unexpected and the planned reset at 2005-300T18:39:00. Another gap      
      occurred beginning at approximately 2005-309:18:00:00 and extended      
      until approximately 2005-314T17:00:00. This gap was the result of       
      data policing by the spacecraft command and data system.                
                                                                              
      During S16, S17, S18 and S19 there were no unexpected processor         
      resets. Telemetry gaps of more than 1 file occurred on 2006-006,        
      007, 036, 037, 044, 045 and 081 resulting in one or more L1A files      
      being absent from the data for those days.                              
                                                                              
      During S20 and S21 there were no unexpected processor resets.           
      Data gaps of more than one hour occurred on days 2006-096,              
      120, 121, 122, 124, 145, 158, 159 162 and 167, resulting in one         
      or more L1A files being absent from the data for those days. The data   
      gaps on days 096, 124, 158 and 159 were due to the instrument being     
      placed in sleep for the orbit trim maneuvers. The remaining were due    
      to telemetry gaps.                                                      
                                                                              
      During S22, S23, S24 there were no unexpected process resets. Data      
      gaps of more than one hour occurred on days 2006-191, 195, 213, 249,    
      253, 257, 267, resulting in one or more L1A files being absent from the 
      data for those days. The data gaps on days 213 and 253 were the result  
      of placing the instrument in sleep mode during orbit trim maneuvers.    
      The gap on day 257 was due to a software update and a planned           
      instrument reset. The remaining gaps were due to telemetry gaps.        
                                                                              
      During S24 (end), S25, S26 (beginning) there were no unexpected         
      processor resets. Data gaps of more than one hour occurred on days      
      2006-274, 286, 287, 288, 290, 298, 299, 311, 312, 313, 344, 349, 354,   
      363, 364, 365, resulting in one or more L1A files being absent from     
      the data for those days. The data gaps on days 274, 290, 313, 349,      
      354, and 365 were the result of placing the instrument in sleep mode    
      during orbit trim maneuvers. The remaining gaps were due to telemetry   
      gaps.                                                                   
                                                                              
      During S26 (end), S27, S28, S29 (beginning) there were no unexpected    
      processor resets. Data gaps of more than one hour occurred on days      
      2007-004, 005, 021, 038, 048, 049, 052, 053, 054, 061, 072, 077, 085,   
      086, 087, 088, resulting in one or more L1A files being absent from the 
      data for those days. The data gaps on days 021, 038, 061, 072, 077 and  
      087 were the result of placing the instrument in sleep mode during      
      orbit trim maneuvers. The remaining gaps were due to telemetry gaps.    
                                                                              
      During S29 (end), S30, S31 (beginning) there were no unexpected         
      processor resets. Data gaps of more than one hour occurred on days      
      2007-092, 093, 094, 095, 109, 122, 124, 139, 141, 152, 156, 159, 160,   
      168, 170, 172, 173, resulting in one or more L1A files being absent     
      from the data for those days. The data gaps on days 109, 124, 141, 152, 
      156, 168, 172, and 173 were the result of placing the instrument in

      the instrument in sleep mode to allow sufficient data volume            
      for an MRO. The gaps on days 015, 016, and 027 were the result          
      of placing the instrument in sleep mode for an RSS experiment           
      (an orbit trim maneuver followed the RSS experiment on day 016,         
      so INMS remained in sleep mode until 07:15:15).                         
      The gaps on days 037, 050, 061, 067, 073, and 074 were the result of

      occurred on days 006, 024, 027, 028, 029, 070, and 077                  
      resulting in one or more L1A files being absent from the data for those 
      days.  The gap on day 070 was the result of placing the                 
      instrument in sleep mode during an orbit trim maneuver.  The remaining  
      gaps were due to telemetry gaps.

      of more than 1 hour occurred on days 207-210, 213-215, 234-236, and 258,
      resulting in one or more L1A files being absent for those days. Data    
      loss on 213-215 was due to DSN issues.  Data loss on 258, was due to    
      end of mission.  Data losses on 207-210 and 234-236 were due to putting 
      the instrument in sleep so that new tables could be loaded to the       
      instrument over several DSN passes.

    During the period from launch through 2004-256, a flight software         
    error caused data corruption when mass scans were accumulated to          
    reduce data rates. These data are identified by a value of the            
    COADD_CNT greater than 1.                                                 
                                                                              
    Prior to 2005-058 the flight software velocity compensation               
    algorithm clipped only the lens voltage that reached its limit,           
    allowing the other three voltages to be adjusted. This resulted in        
    the voltages failing to maintain their proper relation- ships. This       
    was corrected by insuring that once one voltage reached its limit,        
    all four voltages were frozen.                                            
                                                                              
    Data collected at low altitudes at Titan must be used with                
    caution. There appears to be significant contamination due to             
    thruster exhaust scattering into the instrument.
