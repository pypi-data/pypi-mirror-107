  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The rates are reported are in units of counts/sec.  Each entry in
    the browse document is averaged over a fifteen minute time span to
    reduce the amount of data to make it more condusive for browsing.  The
    thirty minute average is filtered using a 'Quality Controlled
    Averaging'  routine developed by Dennis Haggerty and Tom Armstrong for
    Ulysses HiScale [HAGGERTY93].  The energetic particle data included in
    this browse set are summarized by Williams et al. [WILLIAMSETAL91]."

      CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE         = "

    Data in this browse set includes only that data which has
    valid data flag markers as a result of processing done by the Galileo
    Energetic Particles Detector Archive Processor [EPDPROC91]."
