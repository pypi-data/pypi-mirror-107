     This data set consists of all of the uncalibrated data collected by the 
     Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) on-board the Cassini spacecraft      
     during the entire Cassini mission.  CAPS produces the following data    
     products:

     Ion Mass Spectrometer ion data (ION)                                    
     Ion Mass Spectrometer singles data (SNG)                                
     Ion Mass Spectrometer logicals data (LOG)                               
     Ion Mass Spectrometer 'time of flight' (TOF) linear electric field (LEF)
       and straight through data (ST)                                        
     Actuator data (ACT)

     These data were acquired in a mix of CAPS operating modes beginning with
     the first instrument checkout in January 1999 and continuing throughout 
     the Cassini Tour and through the end of prime mission.  The data set    
     covers the time period from 1999-004T03:07:47 UT until end of prime     
     mission (July 2008).  In addition, it will cover any data received      
     during an extended mission.  Sampling rates were variable and depended  
     upon the downlink capabilities and other activities on-board.           
                                                                             
     For times when CAPS is not producing data due to being turned off or    
     due to communication issues, the data set will not contain data.        
     This effect can be sensor/data type specific.

     Data Sampling                                                           
     -------------                                                           
       Data acquisition strategies varied throughout the mission.  During the   
       cruise phase, the instrument was only capable of 2 distinct rates. In 
       addition, the spacecraft telemetry modes were not fully developed     
       which lead to peculiar recording strategies as well.  As the mission  
       progressed, the flight software for both the CAPS instrument and the  
       Cassini spacecraft matured.  During the Jupiter period, the spacecraft
       implemented data policing, where an instrument was assigned a data    
       allocation and the spacecraft would not record any more data from an  
       instrument who had reached their negotiated limit.  This strategy was 
       useful during the planning process, but careful control had to be     
       exercised to not run over the allocation.  Data gaps in the CAPS data 
       can come from a variety of sources:  instrument was off, specific     
       sensors were off, ground communication problems, CAPS over-allocation 
       issues, the instrument was in sleep mode for Probe activities, or     
       there was a problem with commanding on-board the spacecraft.          
                                                                             
       During the cruise phase, the average data rate for CAPS was low.  If  
       at all possible, the instrument was set to cycle between our lowest   
       rate in order to get contiguous data) and a higher rate (for higher   
       resolution data).  The combined high & low rate were designed to give 
       us the average low rate data.  This scheme did not change as we       
       entered Approach Science and Tour, but the average data rate was      
       increased.  In addition to running in survey mode, we also acquired   
       data in higher resolution modes around Magnetospheric boundaries,     
       Titan flybys, icy satellite flybys, ring & satellite campaigns, and   
       distant torus observations.   n addition, any data volume allocation  
       that was not allocated to other instruments was distributed to those  
       who could take advantage of the increase in data volume (and hence    
       data resolution).                                                     
                                                                             
       At the maximum CAPS telemetry rate of 16 kbits/s all data products    
       coming out of the science and calibration modes can be accommodated   
       without the need for compression. The exception is the compressed     
       extraction of ions by the SAM algorithm, and a semi-logarithmic       
       collapse of all data words. The collapse replaces 16-bit data words   
       stored in the DPU with 8-bit data words to be returned to Earth.  For 
       small data numbers, the 8-bit values are equal to the 16-bit values,  
       but for higher values the scale is logarithmic. A similar 32- to      
       16-bit compression is used for TOF data. As a result of this          
       compression, the uncertainty in the higher data numbers is            
       roughly +/- 0.015N rather than the statistical +/- N^(1/2).  No       
       attempt was made to carry out more exotic on-board compression        
       routines such as moment calculations or image-like compressions, with 
       the exception of a run-length compression of the sparse, IBS data.    
                                                                             
       The contents of the CAPS data products at 16 kbits/s are distributed  
       among the three sensors, the ACT and housekeeping channels as         
       indicated below.  Data products are organized along A-cycle (32.0 s)  
       boundaries. Acquisition and formation of B-cycle data products is     
       more complex than the A-cycle process: The CPU2 extracts TOF data in  
       the form of 512 channels each of ST and LEF data.  In the default     
       mode, adjacent energy steps are sampled to produce                    
       2RES x 32E x 512TOF = 32,768 words. In the standard CAPS telemetry    
       mode of 16 kbits/s, each word of B-cycle data is summed over 8        
       A-cycles, whereas for some lower rate modes it is summed over 16      
       A-cycles (i.e., the B-cycle is 8 A-cycles long for the 16 kbits/s mode
        and 16 A-cycles long for these other modes).  In the                 
       very early CAPS data, there was even a mode where it is summed over 32
       A-cycles.  Most CAPS data products are generated at lower data rates  
       by collapsing (summing) the 16 kbps data over adjacent energy,        
       elevation and/or azimuth bins. In addition, snapshots (uncollapsed    
       subsets of the 16 kbps data) may be included. The subset of data      
       included in the snapshot can be determined on the spacecraft, so that 
       the snapshot contains the peak of the velocity distribution. Leaving  
       out certain products entirely produces the smallest possible datasets.
       The modes used by the CAPS instrument were revised prior to the       
       Cassini Jupiter encounter to include 0.25, 0.5, and 1 kbps rates, in  
       addition to the original 2 and 16 kbps modes. These modes were further
       revised before reaching Saturn, to add 4 and 8 kbps modes and         
       incorporate experience from analysis of the Jupiter data. Other data  
       products that can be included as options (at the expense of sensor    
       data) are memory readout of control tables for diagnostic purposes.   
       Sequential event data that are used to verify IMS operations can also 
       be included.

  ==========                                                                 
                                                                             
    The uncalibrated counts are collected, collapsed, and compressed on board
    the spacecraft.  The data is then downlinked to the Jet Propulsion Query 
    Servers where it is queried from the server (in standard data unit       
    format, SFDU) and ingested into the CAPS oracle database and stored as   
    CCSDS packets.  From this point, the data is collected into blocks of    
    CCSDS packets which comprise an A-cycle (32 seconds) of data.  These     
    data are then decompressed into their separate sensor pieces and stored  
    as raw, decompressed counts in tables in the database.  From this point, 
    archive files are generated with the raw, decompressed counts, into      
    uncalibrated data set files.                                             
                                                                             
    For the ancillary files (ANC), the reconstructed c-kernel is used to get 
    the most accurate pointing information into the file for team use.       
    Daily, automated checking is performed to make sure we have the most     
    recent files that are available.  Any other information necessary is     
    found in the CAPS database, which has been populated from the raw CCSDS  
    packets.                                                                 
                                                                             
    For the actuator data product (ACT), in December 2004 the position       
    monitor became unreliable.  Based on our understanding of the position   
    at the time the monitor failed, the actuator file was updated with an    
    estimated value.  This estimation continued until TBD time, at which     
    point the actuator was moved and began reporting reliable readings again.
    While trying to move the actuator to +90 degrees on March 21, 2005, we   
    again encountered a time period where the position was adjusted to       
    account for the monitor reading unreliably.  On May 26, 2005 at 10:00:00,
    the actuator position monitor was modified in the flight software to be  
    the estimated position instead of the hardware position.  This data is   
    also corrected before being placed into the archive file to account for  
    any drift in the estimated position.

    The data are stored in multiple data files and have been organized by    
    sensor type, and further subdivided by data type.  Each file contains a  
    maximum of 6 hours of data, with only 4 files being generated per day per
    product.  Format of the data files can be found in the CAPS instrument   
    archive specification [FURMANETAL2005].  The format can also be found in 
    the .FMT files in the FM/UNCALIBRATED directory.  The timestamps,        
    position data, and other spacecraft information were processed using     
    SPICE kernels.  The Cassini SPICE kernels are archived at

    Most ancillary data needed can be found in the ANC data file provided    
    with the data.  In addition, there are other files that are necessary to 
    process the data.  These include sweep tables for each sensor and a table
    of instrument anomalies and resolutions.

      There are many gaps in the CAPS data stream and there are many         
      different sources for these gaps.  Sources of gaps are as follows:     
         a. telemety outages                                                 
         b. data policing violations (CAPS data volume higher than allocated)
         c. incorrect spacecraft data mangement commanding                   
         d. telemetry commanding during Cruise                               
         e. instrument anomalies                                             
         f. instrument modes which don't return all data products            
         g. planned instrument power-off and/or sleep periods                
      When there is no data for a time period, one of the above sources is   
      the reason behind the gap.  There is no indicator to which of the      
      sources is responsible for the gap in data coverage.                   
                                                                             
    Poor Data                                                                
    ---------                                                                
      When the instrument transmitts the data, there is an associated        
      checksum that is checked during decompression.  If the checksum is     
      incorrect, the data are flagged as having a 'bad checksum'.  The other 
      way to get poor data is when we are missing part of the data product   
      and use fill data to complete the product.  The data product is then   
      labelled as having both a 'bad checksum and fill'.  There is an        
      inidicator for 'no data', but the indicator does not tell why the data 
      is missing.  The 'no data' indicator is only used if there is data for 
      any of the other sensors. This information can be found in the ancillay
      data file.  Each sensor and/or data type has its own quality flag.     
      Fill values for each sensor can be found in [FURMANETAL2005] or in the 
      corresponding .FMT file.                                               
                                                                             
    Sensor Gains                                                             
    ------------                                                             
      Sensor gains were set for each sensor based upon calibration           
      information determined on the ground.  While in-flight, sensor         
      calibrations were performed and adjustments were made to the gain of a 
      sensor, based upon interpretation of the data by the team and the      
      leader of the sensor.  During the tour phase, calibrations were        
      performed roughly once every 50 days.  The change in gain can't be     
      tracked with the current archive data, but is done with                
      housekeeping information.                                              
                                                                             
    Anomalies                                                                
    ---------                                                                
      There are currently way to many anomalies to put in at the moment.     
      I'll start working on it.  I plan to describe the time coverage of the 
      anomaly, the affect on the data, diagnosis of the problem, and when (if
      at all) we were able to fix the problem.                               
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
      The main limitation to using this data set is that the data are not    
      calibrated.  Please use the CALIBRATED data set for calibrated data.   
      A secondary limitation is to make sure to use the ancillary data files 
      to avoid using any poor data.  In addition, care should be taken around
      calibration periods as the sweep table and gain levels are changing.   
      Data around anomaly periods also needs to be carefully considered."
