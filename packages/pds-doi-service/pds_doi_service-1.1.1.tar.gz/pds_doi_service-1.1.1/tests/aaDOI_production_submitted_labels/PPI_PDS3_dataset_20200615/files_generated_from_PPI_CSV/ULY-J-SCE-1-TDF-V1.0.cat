      This data set contains raw radio tracking data from the Ulysses        
      (ULY) Solar Corona Experiment (SCE) obtained during the ULY            
      Jupiter flyby. The data target the Io Plasma Torus (IPT) and           
      cover the period 1992-02-04 20:28 to 1992-02-09 15:44.                 
                                                                             
      The data set includes 10 NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) Archival        
      Tracking Data Files (ATDF or TDF), and documentation. The data         
      are obtained from the Radio Science Support group at JPL. There        
      are basically two types of data: ranging and Doppler (Frequency),      
      recorded as a function of UT Ground Received Time. These ranging       
      and Doppler data are obtained from the standard DSN tracking           
      receivers. Doppler data are often used to infer spacecraft radial      
      motion relative to the tracking antenna.                               
                                                                             
      The radio downlinks from Ulysses were monitored during the             
      passage of the spacecraft through the IPT shortly after closest        
      approach to Jupiter. The electron content of the Io torus was          
      derived from the dispersive phase shift of the S-band (2.3 GHz)        
      signal with respect to the X-band (8.4 GHz) signal. Corrections        
      were applied for non-Jovian contributions to the change in             
      electron content arising from the interplanetary medium and the        
      terrestrial ionosphere. Ulysses' North-to-South encounter              
      trajectory was well suited for investigating the global structure      
      of the Jovian plasma environment near Io's orbit, especially its       
      latitudinal extent and azimuthal variations. (IPT investigation

      Each ATDF data record contains 117 parameters, stored in records       
      of 288 bytes. A physical record (8064 bytes) consists of 28            
      logical records. Among these parameters are signal levels ('AGC' =     
      automatic gain control in dBm), antenna pointing angles, frequency     
      (often referred to simply as 'Doppler'), range, and residuals.         
                                                                             
      Data values are reported at rates no higher than 10 per second.        
      For the Ulysses Jupiter encounter the received frequencies at          
      S-Band and X-band were recorded at a sample time of one per            
      second.                                                                
                                                                             
      The ATDF is described in section TRK-2-25 of the JPL Document          
      820-13 [TRK-2-25]. An ASCII copy of this document (TRK_2_25.TXT)

      Processing                                                             
      ==========                                                             
      ATDFs are files of radiometric data produced by the Network            
      Operations Control Center (NOCC) Navigation Subsystem (NAV). They      
      are derived from Intermediate Data Records by NAV and contain all      
      radiometric measurements received from the DSN station.                
                                                                             
                                                                             
      Data                                                                   
      ====                                                                   
      ATDFs contain precise radio range and Doppler measurements made        
      between DSN ground stations and a spacecraft. During the Ulysses       
      Jupiter encounter, coded waveforms were transmitted from the           
      Earth, relayed by the on-board Ulysses telecommunications system,      
      and received back on Earth. Cross correlation between the              
      transmitted and received waveforms yielded a measurement of the        
      round trip distance, which could then be related to the                
      Earth-Venus distance during the flyby. Doppler shift from the same     
      measurements could be interpreted as relative velocity along the       
      propagation path.                                                      
                                                                             
      An ATDF has a file name of the form 'ydddeeeX.TDF' where 'y' is        
      the least significant digit of the year and 'ddd' is the               
      day-of-year for the first ATDF record. The 'eee' gives day-of-year     
      for the last data record in the ATDF. 'X' indicates file sequence      
      when there are multiple files per start/stop day-of-year ('A' for      
      the first file, 'B' for the second, etc.).                             
                                                                             
      Each ATDF is accompanied by a full PDS detached label with name        
      ydddeeeX.LBL which completely describes the contents of the ATDF.      
      The format and contents are also described in TRK_2_25.TXT in the      
      DOCUMENT/SCE directory this volume. Both the ATDF and its label        
      are stored in the TDF directory of an archival volume.

        A NAIF (PDS Navigation and Ancillary Information) 'transfer'         
        format SPK file is provided for the period 1992-01-05 to             
        1995-10-31. This file contains the positions of Ulysses, Jupiter     
        Earth, the Sun, and Jupiter's four Galilean satellites (Io,          
        Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) in data modules that can be read     
        with software from the NAIF Toolkit. This 'transfer' format SPK      
        file (ULY92106.XSP) is located in the GEOMETRY directory. It is      
        accompanied by a detached PDS label (ULY92106.LBL) which             
        describes some of the SPK file's characteristics.                    
                                                                             
        Before using 'transfer' NAIF files, the user should convert the      
        ASCII carriage-return line-feed delimiters on each record to the     
        default delimiter for text files on the local system, then use       
        the NAIF utility SPACIT to convert the archival file to local        
        binary.

      system; for those that are, the user should consult the SIS for        
      information.

      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing these data has been      
      developed at the University of Bonn (Germany), the Jet Propulsion      
      Laboratory, and other institutions. Because parsing must be done       
      at the bit level, adaptation of the software to other platforms is     
      not always easy. No software has been prepared for general             
      distribution, and none is included with this archive. Users should     
      refer to the PDS labels and Software Interface Specifications          
      (/DOCUMENT/TRK_2_25.TXT) for detailed information on file formats      
      before writing their own software.

      There are no known limitations to use of these data, subject to        
      signal-to-noise considerations which would be typical for systems      
      of this type.

      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data set,       
      the archive was distributed to both PDS and non-PDS personnel,         
      including the PDS Radio Science advisor, for preliminary review.
