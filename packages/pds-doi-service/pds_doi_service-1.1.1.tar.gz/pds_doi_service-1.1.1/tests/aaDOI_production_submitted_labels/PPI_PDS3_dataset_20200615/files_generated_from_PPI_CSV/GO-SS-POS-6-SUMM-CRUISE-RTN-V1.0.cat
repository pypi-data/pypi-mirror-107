    The Galileo trajectory are being archived in fixed heliocentric           
    coordinates. The R component is the Sun-&#10095;spacecraft range given in        
    units of Au (149674000 km).  LAT is the solar latitude given in units     
    of degrees and measured from the ecliptic plane. LON is the solar east    
    longitude measured from the First Point of Aries(1950).
