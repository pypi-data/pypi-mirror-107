       The MARIE (Martian Radiation Environment Experiment), aboard the 2001

    occurred in early August, and the instrument was turned off until         
    early March, 2002, after Odyssey's mapping orbit had been                 
    established. Data have been collected from that time to the present       
    without major interruption. Routine minor interruptions of up to 48       
    hours have occurred during the orbital phase; the outages occur           
    when the instrument's data is erased from local storage (after

  ======================================================================      
                                                                              
    The MARIE consists primarily of silicon detectors, of three               
    different types: the A detectors, which are square in cross-section       
    (25.4 mm on a side) and 1 mm in depth; the B detectors, circular,         
    63.5 mm diameter and 5 mm thick; and the PSDs, or                         
    position-sensitive detectors. The PSDs are square double-sided            
    strip detectors with 24 1 mm strips on each side (the strips on one       
    side are orthogonal to those on the other side), and have a               
    thickness of 0.3 mm. There are two A detectors, A1 and A2;                
    sandwiched in between them are PSD1 and PSD2; behind A2, there are        
    the B detectors, B1 through B4. Downstream of B4 is a circular            
    piece of quartz, 10 mm thick, that radiates photons (Cerenkov             
    radiation) generated by the passage of high-velocity particles            
    through it. The Cerenkov photons are reflected by a 45 degree             
    mirror into a photomultiplier tube that sits out of the path of           
    particles that hit the detectors.                                         
                                                                              
    The MARIE is triggered by a coincidence of hits in detectors A1 and       
    A2. Once triggered, the data acquisition system records 12-bit            
    digitized outputs which are proportional to the energies deposited        
    in the A and B detectors. A two-byte data word is stored for each         
    of these channels. The pulse height from the Cerenkov phototube is        
    similarly digitized in 12 bits and stored.                                
                                                                              
    Readout of the PSDs is more complex. Each PSD has two orthogonal          
    sides, referred to as columns and rows. The following description         
    applies to each side of each detector. Onboard hardware analyzes          
    the signals from each of the 24 strips and finds the two largest          
    pulse heights. For each, the pulse height is digitized in 8 bits          
    (256 channels) and stored, along with the strip number. The largest       
    pulse height and position are referred to as ''event1'', the              
    second-largest as ''event2.'' The event2 data are usually noise.          
    Four quantities are stored for each side of each detector, so that        
    a total of sixteen words (thirty-two bytes) of PSD data are stored        
    on each event. The eight-bit pulse heights are referred to as             
    ''magnitudes'' (abbreviated to ''_Mag'' in the list below). The           
    positions (listed as ''_Pos below) are valid only when in the range       
    1 to 24.                                                                  
                                                                              
    The full 72-byte data structure for each event is listed below.

    The primary data in the REDR data set are the event and count data.       
    The event data files are characterized by file names that begin           
    with EVN.  The count data have file names that begin with CNT.  The       
    other data in the REDR data set are ancillary data.  These are            
    comprised of four types:  board files (names beginning with BRD),         
    detector files (DET), high voltage files (EXT), and power files           
    (PWR).                                                                    
                                                                              
    The event data and the count data are in binary format.  All of the       
    other data types are in ASCII format.                                     
                                                                              
    The six types of files in this dataset are described below, in this       
    and the next section.

    The principal (and normally largest) files in this data set are the       
    event files.  Each record in an event file contains data pertaining       
    to a specific particle detection event.  For this purpose, an             
    ''event'' is considered to occur when a signal is detected by the         
    A1 and A2 cards and is above threshold for both of these cards.  At       
    the time a coincidence of A1 and A2 signals is detected, the              
    digitizers for all detectors are polled, as is MARIE's internal           
    clock, and the data are written to local storage. An event file is a      
    binary table of events.

    A count file is a binary file of count accumulations over one-minute      
    periods. For this purpose, a ''count'' occurs when any card detects       
    a signal that is above its threshold.  The record structure is            
    outlined below.

    Note on 6-byte real values:                                               
    ---------------------------                                               
                                                                              
    A few of the columns (specifically, the Time values) in the CNT           
    and EVN files have the format of a 6-byte real number.  This format       
    is summarized below.  Bits are numbered from left to right, starting      
    with 0 as the high bit of the first byte read in order from the           
    file. (Thus, for example, bit 8 will be the high bit of the byte          
    that is second in file order.)                                            
                                                                              
    Bits 0-7 are an exponent (e).                                             
    Bit 40 is a sign bit (1 for sign = -1, 0 for sign = +1).                  
                                                                              
    The rest of the bits form a 39-bit real m (mantissa).                     
    To calculate this, start with m = 0 and x = 0.5, then run through         
    the bits in the following order, each time adding x if the                
    bit is 1 and then dividing x by 2 regardless of bit value:                
    bits 41-47, 32-39, 24-31, 16-23, 8-15.                                    
                                                                              
    The value of the real number is: sign * (1 + m) * 2**(e - 129).           
                                                                              
    The real number represents the time in minutes on the Julian              
    calendar which takes as its starting time 12 hours Universal Time         
    (Greenwich mean noon) on noon of November 24, -4713.                      
                                                                              
    In the PDS labels for these data, the 6-byte reals are declared as        
    character strings to avoid compatibility problems.  Hence these           
    reals may be displayed as character strings by some software.

    The BRD files differ from the DET files because each board comprises      
    only a part of a detector, and has a separate thermistor which            
    monitors the board's temperature.

    MARIE's internal coordinate system is defined by the geometry of the      
    detector. The PSDs have their own coordinate system in the sense          
    that each strip (corresponding to a row or a column) is assigned a        
    sequential number from 1 to 24. These values are not referenced to        
    any other coordinate system, as the primary purpose of the PSDs is        
    to calculate the angle at which incident particles traverse the           
    silicon detectors. With valid hits in all rows and columns, the           
    angle THETA with respect to the vertical (normal incidence) can be        
    calculated as follows. We define

    d = the distance between PSD1 and PSD2. Then

    MARIE was on for parts of the 2001 Mars Odyssey cruise phase,             
    starting in late April 2001 and ending in late July 2001. A problem       
    with the onboard computer occurred in early August, and the               
    instrument was turned off until mid-March, 2002, after Odyssey's          
    mapping orbit had been established. Data have been collected from         
    that time to the present without major interruption. Routine minor        
    interruptions of up to 36 hours have been encountered during the          
    orbital phase; the outages occur when the instrument's data is            
    erased (after having been downloaded). Additional shorter outages         
    of approximately 2 hours duration occur on a daily basis while data       
    are downloaded.                                                           
                                                                              
    During processing of these data into RDR data, it was found that          
    some of the time stamps may be out of chronological order or              
    contain corrupt values of the year.  These problems do not affect         
    the majority of the data records.

    MARIE's geometry is optimized for detecting particles coming into         
    the detector (hitting A1 first) in a forward cone of half-angle           
    approximately 30 degrees. The angle is defined with respect to the        
    centerline of the silicon detectors. Particles incident at larger         
    angles may hit one or more detectors, but will not satisfy the            
    requirement of coincident hits in A1 and A2. Forward-going                
    particles encounter minimal (but finite) mass before entering             
    MARIE, and must have residual range sufficient to penetrate as far        
    as A2. As of this writing (May 2002), best estimates of the               
    material in front of MARIE lead to the prediction that the minimum        
    free-space (i.e., before encountering any material) kinetic energy        
    required for a proton to reach A2 is about 30 MeV. For helium-4           
    ions, the minimum kinetic energy is 30 MeV/nucleon, and for heavier       
    ions, the energy per nucleon increases as a function of the ion's         
    charge and mass. MARIE can also be triggered by particles entering        
    from the rear, provided they are sufficiently energetic to hit both       
    A2 and A1. For a proton, this corresponds to a minimum energy of 72       
    MeV incident on B4. However, any such particle must pass through a        
    considerable (currently unknown) mass in order to reach B4. (The          
    mass in question is primarily due to Odyssey's oxidizer tank.)            
    Backward-going particles must therefore be far more energetic than        
    their forward-going counterparts in order to trigger MARIE's              
    readout.                                                                  
                                                                              
    In the data, backward-going particles can, in some cases, be              
    distinguished by the patterns of energy deposition they leave in          
    the silicon detectors; for particular particle/energy combinations,       
    these patterns may be quite distinct from those of forward-going          
    particles of the same type and energy. In addition, the Cerenkov          
    detector is directional, and no Cerenkov photons will be recorded         
    for backwards-going particles.

    Saturation of Electronics                                                 
    -------------------------                                                 
                                                                              
    As of May 2002, all MARIE data have been taken with all silicon           
    detectors operating at full depletion. The gains of the electronics       
    combined with the limitations on input voltage into the                   
    analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) - are such that the A channels        
    saturate at approximately 70 MeV energy deposited, while the B            
    channels saturate at about 350 MeV energy deposited. Because              
    deposited energy is a function of the charge (Z) squared of an            
    incident heavy ion, this limits the detectable range of particle          
    charges. In the present configuration, the largest usable signal          
    corresponds to highly-energetic ions of charge 11. For more               
    highly-charged particles, the signals are so large that the               
    digitizer outputs go to full scale, and all resolution is lost.           
    The Galactic Cosmic Radiation contains all elements up to uranium,        
    though ions heavier than iron (charge 26) are rare. At present, and       
    for the foreseeable future, ions with charge 12 and greater are           
    detected by MARIE, but with no resolution.

    PSD Performance                                                           
    ---------------                                                           
                                                                              
    The PSD performance for sparsely-ionizing particles such as protons       
    is known to be marginal. The detectors are thin (300 microm), so          
    that signals are small and noise (which falls with increasing             
    detector depth) is relatively large. The onboard algorithm for            
    finding hits returns many 0 values (no hit found), many more values       
    of 1 than is physically reasonable, and in the case of PSD1               
    columns, many more values of 24 than is physically reasonable. It         
    is likely the case that the edge channels of the PSDs are nosier          
    than those in the middle, and hence are often mistakenly identified       
    by the onboard processing algorithm as having been hit. If the            
    detectors were working optimally, all histograms of row and column        
    positions would show broad distributions peaked in the middle. Only       
    the distribution of hits in the PSD1 rows approximates the expected       
    shape. One possible improvement would be to raise the software            
    thresholds the hit-finding algorithm in the onboard firmware uses.        
    This would result in more ''0'' values (no hit found) but would           
    reduce or eliminate erroneous positions from noise hits. At the           
    time of this writing (Septmber 2002), the instrument team is also         
    investigating the possibility that some non-physical readings             
    are caused by bit flips in the processing firmware. Some of               
    these may be correctable in future processing.

    Cerenkov Detector Performance                                             
    -----------------------------                                             
                                                                              
    The Cerenkov detector performance is currently marginal. Signals          
    are far smaller than expected, which suggests that the voltage on         
    the photomultiplier tube is too low or possibly that the alignment        
    of the 45 degree mirror is bad. Attemps to raise the phototube            
    voltage failed due to a bug in the onboard control software. This         
    may be corrected in the future when new control software is               
    uploaded.

    Clock Issues and Time Tag Significance                                    
    --------------------------------------                                    
                                                                              
    Occasionally, MARIE's clock appears to jump backward by a fairly          
    large interval (often on the order of minutes) from one event to          
    the next. The source of this error is unknown. Usually, within the        
    next few events, the clock jumps ahead to where one would expect it       
    to be. Such jumps have been noted to occur up to 25 times in a file       
    of 50,000 event records. As of this writing (September 2002), the         
    instrument team is unable to diagnose or cure the problem. As few         
    events are affected, and most users will likely be binning data in        
    time bins on the order of many minutes or even hours, these do not        
    present a serious problem.                                                
                                                                              
    A second category of clock problems occurs when MARIE data is being       
    downloaded to the spacecraft's data buffer at midnight.  When this        
    happens, the MARIE clock does not increment the day counter, and          
    when data acquisition resumes, the clock is one day behind.  It           
    remains in this state until the next data erase sequence (which           
    typically occurs about once every 7 to 10 days, depending on solar        
    activity), at which time MARIE's clock is synchronized to the             
    Odyssey master clock and the problem is fixed (until the next time        
    it occurs). For this reason, deliberate efforts have been made to         
    avoid downloading MARIE data over midnight boundaries. While the          
    problem has not been entirely eliminated, the frequency with which        
    it occurs has decreased.                                                  
                                                                              
    --------------------------------------                                    
    Calibration Issues                                                        
    --------------------------------------                                    
    There are considerable uncertainties in the calibration constants         
    that are used to convert raw pulse height readings to deposited           
    energies. For the A1 and A2 detectors, we estimate the                    
    uncertainties to be +- 20%. For the B detectors, we estimate the          
    uncertainties to be +- 15%. These are uncertainties in the                
    absolute scale of deposited energy; they are not expected to vary         
    significantly within a particular data set, but they may show             
    long-term variations. As of this writing (Dec. 2002), further             
    work to determine these constants with greater precision is in            
    progress, using stopping protons from Solar Particle Events.              
    Periodic monitoring of the constants will be needed to look for,          
    and correct, any drifts in amplifier gains."
