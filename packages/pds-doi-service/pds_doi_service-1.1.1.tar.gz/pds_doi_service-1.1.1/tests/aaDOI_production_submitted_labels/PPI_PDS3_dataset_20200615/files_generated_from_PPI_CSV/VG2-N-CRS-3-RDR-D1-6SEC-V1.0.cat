      The D1 rate is the counting rate from the D1 detector                   
      of the Cosmic Ray System (CRS) electron telescope (TET).                
      When the rate is above background it is approximately                   
      proportional to the omnidirectional flux of electrons                   
      with kinetic energy greater than ~1 MeV.                                
      To obtain an accurate flux the D1 calibration tables                    
      should be used (see below).  When the rate is near                      
      background, the background rate should be subtracted.                   
      The background rate is due to gamma rays generated in                   
      the spacecraft RTG and to penetrating cosmic rays.  It                  
      varies slightly with time on the time scale of months,                  
      but is generally near 25 counts per second.  When the                   
      rate is near saturation, corrections for discriminator                  
      deadtime should be made.  The discriminator deadtime is                 
      approximately 20 micro-seconds (it varies slightly with                 
      the electron energy spectrum), so that the saturation                   
      level is approximately 50,000 counts per second.                        
      When the correction is near a factor of two or less                     
      a reliable corrected rate can be obtained from the formula              
      {corrected rate} = {uncorrected rate}/(1+deadtime*{uncorrected rate})   
      When the deadtime correction is substantially larger than               
      a factor of two, reliable corrections are not available.                
      In this case, electron pileup and baseline shift may also               
      be important, which may increase or decrease the expected               
      rate.  The data points are 6 second averages taken                      
      once every 96 seconds.                                                  
                                                                              
      Table 1 below provides the D1 response function R(E,theta)              
      which is a function of electron energy E in MeV (column at left)        
      and angle theta in degrees from the TET axis (row at top).              
      Each table entry is R in cm**2 for the corresponding E and theta.       
      The D1 electron rate is related to the differential intensity           
      j(E,alpha) in (cm**2 s sr MeV)**-1, where alpha is the electron         
      pitch-angle, by integrating the product R*j over E and solid angle.     
      Note that the angle between the TET axis and the local magnetic         
      field direction is also required.  The D1 RATE is then obtained         
      by adding the background rate and applying the inverse of the           
      deadtime correction described above.  At energies above the             
      maximum provided R can be approximated by the value at the              
      highest provided energy.  At angles above the maximum provided R        
      can be approximated by zero.

    The ENCYCLOPEDIA GENERATOR program was run by Nand Lal at Goddard         
    Space Flight Center to read the EDR tape, check for error                 
    conditions, and reformat the data to generate a CRS encyclopedia          
    tape. The resulting tape was sent to CalTech for subsequent data          
    analysis.                                                                 
                                                                              
    The VCRUSH program was run at CalTech to select data of interest          
    from CRS encyclopedia tapes. In the case of counting rate data,           
    no further analysis was done to produce the data in the PDS               
    data sets.

    Each data point represents a six-second accumulation,                     
    so that the statistical uncertainty is obtained according                 
    to Poisson statistics by taking the square root of one sixth              
    of the counting rate. However, larger uncertainties are                   
    associated with the conversion from counting rate to flux.

    The following table contains hourly summaries of the percentage of        
    the data available, data quality, and contamination codes. A data         
    quality id of -1 indicates that no attempt has been made to specify       
    a data quality for this time range. A contamination code of -1            
    signifies that no evaluation of possible contamination has been           
    made.
