This data set contains the attitude data for the rotor of the Galileo         
spacecraft. The data provided are derived from the Attitude and               
Articulation Control System (AACS) data downlink as provided by the           
Galileo project to the magnetometer team. This data set covers                
portions of the Jupiter Approach (JA) and all orbit operation mission         
phases (J0-J35). The data are discontinuous. The sampling frequency           
varies with mission phase. The coverage period is from                        
1995-11-28T01:34 to 2001-09-21 (exact time of last sample                     
is currently unknown).                                                        
                                                                              
Data Sampling                                                                 
=============                                                                 
                                                                              
The data set is derived from 3 downlink sources, depending on the mission     
phase.  During the recorded intervals, attitude data are played back with     
the other recorded fields and particles data. During these periods data are   
available every minor frame (~2/3 second). Attitude data in these periods     
are all sampled at the same time, no interpolation is required.               
                                                                              
When real-time Science (RTS) data are being acquired, attitude data are       
acquired simultaneously once every 5 major frames (~5 minutes).               
                                                                              
When neither RTS or recorded data are being acquired, AACS data are           
only returned in the engineering stream, not as a true data stream. The       
data during these intervals are subcommutated. Right Ascension (RA),          
Declination (DEC), and Rotor Twist values are not synchronously sampled.      
In order to make the data from these intervals useful, the RA and DEC data    
have been linearly interpolated to the time of the twist samples. Samples     
from these intervals are available about once every two hours. Only the       
MAG and DDS instruments acquire data during these mission phases. This        
sampling frequency is adequate given the long averages acquired by these      
instruments during these mission phases.                                      
                                                                              
Data Processing                                                               
===============                                                               
                                                                              
When data are simultaneously available from all three AACS channels, no       
processing is applied other than to convert data numbers into radians.        
When data are not simultaneously sampled, the RA and DEC values are           
linearly interpolated between samples to the time of the TWIST samples.       
Beginning in Phase 2A, the rotor spin angle was no longer included in the     
downlink. This value is calculated on the ground by using the values of       
RA, DEC, and TWIST and the difference between Earth's equatorial and          
ecliptic poles.                                                               
                                                                              
The EME-50 to System III (1965) rotation matrix is computed by using the      
SPICE SPK kernel S980326B.XSP (final prime mission reconstruction). These     
values can be reproduced by using the following pseudo-code fragment:

The basic rotor coordinate system has its Z-axis aligned with the spin        
axis (positive in the opposite direction as the HGA) and its +Y-axis          
pointing outward from the spacecraft body along the magnetometer boom.        
X completes the right handed set. This coordinate system spins with the       
rotor at a period of approximately 19 seconds.                                
                                                                              
Earth Mean Equator and dynamical equinox of Besselian year 1950 (EME-50)      
is an inertial coordinate system used by the Galileo project for              
navigation purposes. This system also commonly known as Fundamental           
Catalog (4) or 'FK4' by the SPICE software. At the reference epoch, this      
system has its +Z axis parallel to the Earth's north pole and its +X axis     
points to the first point of Aries.                                           
                                                                              
System III (1965) is the standard planetographic (left handed) coordinate     
system as defined by the IAU for Jupiter [DESSLER1983]. The Central           
Meridian Longitude is taken at 00 UTC on January 1, 1965. The rotation        
period for Jupiter is defined to be 9h 55m 29.71s (870.536 deg/day). "        
                                                                              
CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE          = "                                            
                                                                              
The AACS data are basically raw data that have been converted to physical     
units. There are some data spikes and dropouts (zero filled) in the data      
set. In areas where RA and DEC values needed to be linearly interpolated,     
obviously bad points were edited out before interpolating. No attempt has     
been made to interpolate data in the vicinity of spacecraft maneuvers.        
The spacecraft has a wobble that is less than a milliradian in amplitude.     
Linear interpolation, where applied does not reproduce this wobble. The       
basic attitude data is expected to be reliable at nearly the quantization     
level of about 0.0001 radians.                                                
                                                                              
During the Phase 2A mission the rotor spin angle is no longer included        
in the downlink. The difference between the spin angle and the twist          
angle is strictly a function of the rotor RA and DEC. This difference is      
computed on the ground and subtracted from the twist angle to generate        
spin angle where it is missing (after May, 1996).                             
                                                                              
The rotation matrix data have been generated by software from the Galileo     
project approved SPICE kernels. The software has been tested extensively      
and verified.  Data can be considered to be reliable to the precision         
implied by the number of significant digits provided."
