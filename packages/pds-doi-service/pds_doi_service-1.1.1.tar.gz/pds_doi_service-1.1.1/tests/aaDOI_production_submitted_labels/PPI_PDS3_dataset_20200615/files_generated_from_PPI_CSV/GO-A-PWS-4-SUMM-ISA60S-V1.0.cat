    This data set includes all available Low Rate Science spectrum analyzer
    data within the interval of time covered. The data included in this set
    have been checked for accuracy by including only those words from the
    telemetry stream which did not have parity errors based on parity bits
    included with the data as part of the PWS data processing unit functions.
    The magnetic spectra contain narrowband interference lines at 2.4 kHz and
    harmonics.  Missing data are indicated by zero."
