  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set consists of ASCII formatted characteristic frequency and 
    electron plasma density measurements as determined from the Galileo 
    Plasma Wave Science (PWS) instrument spectrum data and calculated from
    the equations of cold plasma theory.  All measurements collected for this
    volume originate with the 152-channel low rate survey electric spectra.
    This is a whole mission archive in that coverage for this dataset is
    simply all times for which plasma density measurements from the
    Galileo PWS are available when it is in the vicinity of Jupiter.

    Individual records are gathered into daily files by spacecraft event
    time (SCET).  When well characterized emissions are present in the
    survey spectra the data rate is one point per electric spectrum, which
    works out to one point every 18.7 seconds, or one point every 37.3 
    seconds depending on the instrument's operating mode.  During times
    when emissions could not be characterized no density measurements are
    provided.
  
  Parameters
  ==========
    While the data essential to this volume are the electron plasma densities,
    there are a number of other plasma parameters included within these
    records.  The data set consists of PDS SPREADSHEET objects with one record
    per time step.  The time step is not fixed but varies depending on the
    measurement method (field 12).

    Each record begins with the following space and time location parameters
    in fields 1 through 10: 
        
       1. The spacecraft event time (SCET)
       2. Spacecraft radial distance from the center of Jupiter
       3. Spacecraft Jovigraphic west longitude
       4. Spacecraft Jovigraphic local time
       5. Spacecraft latitude
       6. Spacecraft magnetic local time
       7. Spacecraft magnetic latitude
       8. Spacecraft Jupiter Solar Ecliptic coordinates, X
       9. Spacecraft Jupiter Solar Ecliptic coordinates, Y
      10. Spacecraft Jupiter Solar Ecliptic coordinates, Z
  
    If available, each record includes the following MAG instrument data
    in field 11.  If MAG data are not available for the given spacecraft
    event time, then this field is empty:

      11. The electron cyclotron frequency, fCE

    Each data product record contains measurement methods and results in
    fields 12 through 16:

      12. The measurement method (line-plots, spectrograms, or 
          spectrograms with algorithm-assist)
      13. The measured frequency value
      14. A quality flag for the measurement clairity
      15. The name of the measured frequency (fPE, fR=0, fL=0, fUH)
      16. An indicator for measurements made in the solar wind

    Each record contains the resulting characteristic cold-plasma
    frequencies in fields 16 through 19.  Not all frequencies are present
    for each record, as fields 18, 19 and 20 depend on fCE:

      17. The electron plasma frequency, fPE
      18. The ordinary mode cutoff frequency, fL=0
      19. The extraordinary mode cutoff frequency, fR=0
      20. The upper hybrid resonance frequency, fUH 
      
    Finally, each record contains the corresponding electron plasma number
    density in field 21:

      21. The calculated electron density, Ne

    Of the four plasma frequencies (fields 17-20), one is a copy of the
    measured cutoff or resonance (field 13),  while the remaining frequencies
    are calculated using static magnetic field magnitude and the equations of
    cold plasma theory as described in [BARNHARTETAL2009].  Again, data from
    the Galileo magnetometer are not always available.  During these times
    fCE, fUH, fR=0 and fL=0 are not present.

    More detailed definition of data records and field definitions are 
    supplied in the product labels that accompany each data product file 
    on this volume.  All data products have the same format.

    
  Processing
  ==========
    The data on this volume were derived from measuring either plasma electron
    frequency cutoff (fPE), the Z-mode cutoff (fL=0), or the upper hybrid
    resonance (fUH).  They were produced over a multi-year period by three
    different investigators; Ansher, Richards, and Barnhart, working under the
    direction of D. A. Gurnett (Ansher, Richards) and W.S. Kurth (Barnhart).
    
    Ansher's data collection measured the cutoff in continuum radiation in
    regions where fPE &#10095; fCE.  Richards continued Ansher's work marking
    continuum cutoff's and in addition added measurements of fUH peaks when
    present.  Both investigators were assisted by technicians who marked
    cutoffs or peaks in individual spectra, one line plot at a time.  Ansher's
    proceedure and methods are provided in chapter three of the document
    ANSHER_2001.PDF while Richard's are available section 2.1 of the document
    RICHARDS_2006.PDF.  Both documents are available in the DOCUMENT directory
    of this volume.

    Utilizing new software tools, Barnhart extended the dataset to include
    times when fPE &#10094; fCE by considering cutoffs and peaks in Z-mode
    emissions, and revised some previous measurements by designating them
    as Z-mode emissions.  The newer tools at his disposal presented a time-
    frequency-amplitude color spectrogram to the user and thus required much
    less manual labor.  The methods he used to review and extend frequency
    measurements on this volume are very similar to those employed to generate
    the data on PDS volume VGPW_0201 and are given in the included document,
    BARNHART_2009.PDF.  Most of the following processing narrative is from
    the point of view of the last investigator to determine plasma densities
    from PWS spectra, Barnhart, though in fact this is a combined work.

    ----

    The ASCII density data files produced in this volume were derived
    from measuring the characteristic frequencies from the local plasma.
    The density was calculated from these data, along with cyclotron
    frequency data derived from magnetic field data, using the equations
    of cold plasma theory as described in [BARNHARTETAL2009].  Since the
    electron plasma frequency fPE, is directly proportional to the electron
    number density, plasma wave science instrument data alone are sufficient
    to determine densities when these cutoffs are apparent in the wave
    spectra.  For all other digitized frequencies MAG instrument data were
    required to calculate the electron density.
    
    In order to measure these characteristic frequencies, this effort 
    utilizes a new program that allows the operator to highlight the 
    general vicinity of the cutoff or resonance on a frequency-time 
    spectrogram.  Then, an algorithm finds the cutoff or resonance in 
    the region and records the frequency at 1 second intervals.  Hence,
    the automated procedure has a high temporal resolution (18.7 second) 
    and requires a relatively low level of both manual effort and
    subjective judgment by the operator.

    There are two different algorithms used: one for cutoff detection
    and one for resonance or peak detection.  The cutoff detection 
    algorithm is controlled by a small number of parameters that can 
    be set by the operator.  The first parameter is the cutoff level.  
    In determining possible cutoff candidates, the algorithm scans the 
    region highlighted by the operator and records two separate points,
    one above the cutoff level and one below.  The closer the two points
    are, temporally, the steeper the slope will be.  Therefore, the 
    operator can change the location of the cutoff level to manipulate 
    where the algorithm looks for cutoffs within the highlighted region
    of interest.  The next parameter is the slope magnitude, which 
    designates the minimum magnitude of the finite difference slope 
    where the cutoff must reside.  The operator may raise the slope 
    level in order to scan only for sharp cutoffs, or lower it in order
    to accommodate less steep slopes, depending on the quality of the 
    spectrum data.  When there is more than one possible cutoff, the 
    detection program will display them as cutoff candidates.  The 
    cutoff level, slope magnitude and cutoff candidates are displayed by
    the program for viewing by the operator.  While the algorithm 
    chooses the lowest frequency cutoff by default, the operator may 
    override the algorithm and choose any of the possible cutoffs to be
    recorded.
    
    While most of the characteristic frequencies are, by definition, 
    the cutoff of propagating wave modes, there are certain 
    circumstances when the characteristic frequency is denoted as the
    peak of a wave mode in the spectrum.  Because of this, there is an
    algorithm specifically for resonance or peak detection.  Many 
    spectra of interest to this study include Z-mode radiation, which 
    has a low-frequency cutoff at fL=0.  Barbosa et al. 
    [BARBOSAETAL1990B] demonstrated that taking the peak of the Z-mode
    as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the determination of 
    fpe.  Hence, when the Z-mode is enhanced, we utilize the peak 
    detection algorithm to identify fL=0 from which fpe and the 
    electron density can be derived.  This algorithm can also be used 
    to determine fUH when an enhancement at that frequency is present 
    in the spectrum.  In order to measure this resonance or spectral 
    peak, the peak detection algorithm fits a Gaussian curve to the 
    highest peak within the region specified by the program operator.  
    The algorithm then records the frequency of the Gaussian's peak 
    as the peak frequency in the spectrum.  The algorithm displays 
    the spectrum and a darker line which is the Gaussian.  Because 
    there may be noise which exhibits a large peak in the highlighted 
    spectrum, the spectrum is displayed along with the Gaussian curve 
    and a vertical line designating where the peak was measured.  
    The operator always has the ability to manually change the peak's 
    location and alter the measurement in such cases.  
     
    While the operator utilizes a color spectrogram to guide the cutoff
    and peak detectors, we emphasize that this is only used as a means
    of identifying the appropriate range in frequency for the algorithm
    to search.  The direct use of color spectrograms tends to mislead 
    an operator to perceive a cutoff that is not equivalent to the 
    cutoff in the actual power spectrum [BARBOSAETAL1990B]. Because
    this may lead to a systematic error in the data, the algorithm 
    utilizes the spectrum itself, and does not depend on a color scale 
    to determine the characteristic frequencies. This should reduce 
    systematic error and lead to more accurate results. 


  Data Coverage
  =============
    This data set does not provide complete coverage of the time
    intervals when Galileo was within Jupiter's magnetosphere.  Two 
    criteria were necessary in order for density measurements to be 
    obtained.  First, plasma wave data must exist.  Because of the failure
    of Galileo's high gain antenna, there are many intervals for which there
    are no plasma wave data.  Second, a suitable feature must be present in
    the spectrum which can reliably be used to identify a characteristic
    frequency of the plasma related to the electron density, such as fPE, 
    fUH, or fL=0.

    By far the most prevalent emission of use is the non-thermal continuum
    radiation, whose low frequency cutoff is at fPE.  This radiation
    literally fills the magnetosphere between the magnetopause and higher
    density regions of the inner magnetosphere, typically beyond 25 RJ
    (see illustration DOCUMENTS/A_D79_358_1.PNG).  However, some regions
    include other emissions and regions when the plasma frequency does not
    have a clear cutoff.  If the plasma frequency is not measured directly
    from the spectrum for any reason, it may be calculated from the local
    magnetic field data (essentially fCE) and one of three other
    characteristic frequencies using the equations of cold plasma theory.
    Thus, magnetic field data must  exist for regions when fPE is not
    present, or the electron density cannot be calculated.  Typically,
    continuum radiation is not present inside of approximately 20 to 25
    Jovian radii.  Data exists typically from approximately 20 to 65 Jovian
    radii.  Inside of about 10 RJ there is often a narrow band feature at
    fUH which, when fCE is available, can provide fPE.
      
  Interpretations
  ===============
    Low rate science survey data were used to measure characteristic
    frequencies (peaks and cutoffs) which relate to the electron plasma
    density.  When dealing with a variety of spectrograms and plasma
    conditions found in different regions of the Jovian magnetosphere, it
    is necessary to interpret the present modes and characteristic
    frequencies correctly in order to determine the most accurate value
    for the electron plasma density.  Below, we will briefly discuss the
    methods used for interpreting different spectra.
    
    The simplest spectra to interpret for the purposes of determining
    the electron plasma density are those that include non-thermal
    continuum radiation with a clear low frequency cutoff and with no
    other emissions obscuring the cutoff.  For the purposes of this 
    data set, we agree with the Gurnett et al. [1981B] interpretation 
    that based upon spectra data it is appropriate to assume that the 
    continuum radiation cutoff is fPE and we can accurately determine 
    the local electron plasma density using the appropriate equation 
    from cold plasma theory.  The electron plasma density is directly 
    proportional to the square of the electron plasma frequency and 
    therefore in this case the determination of the density does not 
    depend on magnetic field measurements.  When there is only one 
    cutoff present in the continuum radiation, we assume that the 
    continuum radiation is propagating in the ordinary mode and that 
    the cutoff is indeed the plasma frequency.  An alternate possibility
    would be to identify this cutoff as the fR=0 cutoff at fR=0.  But, 
    most theories [Shaw and Gurnett, 1980; Moses et. al., 1987; 
    Barbosa et al., 1990] favor the L,O mode as the most likely
    continuum radiation component, hence, we assume that there is always
    at least some L,O component present when the continuum radiation is
    detected.

    Sometimes, more than one wave mode cutoff is present at different 
    frequencies for the same time period.  When this is the case, one
    way to resolve the ambiguity is to use a guess-and-check system as
    follows:
    
    1. Assume that one frequency cutoff/peak present in the spectrum is
       a particular characteristic frequency. 

    2. Use the local magnetic field data (which determines fCE) along
       with the equations from cold plasma theory to calculate the
       remaining characteristic frequencies. 

    3. Look for consistency between the calculated frequencies and the
       remaining spectral features (cutoffs/peaks) present.

    A consistent interpretation is one where the calculated frequencies
    match the cutoffs/peaks present in the spectrum.  In some examples
    there exist two spectral cutoffs which need identification in order
    to calculate the electron plasma density.  By using a Consistency
    Check, (mainly, assuming fPE is the lower cutoff and calculating the
    remaining characteristic frequencies) it is found that when the
    plasma frequency is assumed to be the lower frequency cutoff, the
    cutoff at higher frequencies matches the calculated R=0 frequency.

    The guess-and-check system was used by [BARNHARDTETAL2009] with Voyager
    wide band waveform observations that have significantly higher spectral
    resolution that do the Galileo survey data used here.  Hence, it is
    less likely that the Galileo spectral resolution will allow the routine
    use of guess-and-check.   

    In addition to the non-thermal continuum radiation with a low
    frequency cutoff at fPE, another mode of propagating waves (called
    Z-mode) is sometimes also present.  Based upon results from our 
    consistency checks and in agreement with the previous work of 
    Barbosa et. al. [1990], we conclude that there are two types of 
    Z-mode radiation: weak, broadband Z-mode and intense, narrow band 
    Z-mode. We interpret the L=0 frequency as the cutoff of the weak, 
    broadband radiation, however, when the Z-mode emission becomes 
    intense we have found that taking the L=0 frequency as the peak of 
    the intense emission gives the most consistent estimate for fL=0.  
    This is because as the intensity of this peak increases, the width 
    of the emission appears to broaden due to limitations in the Fourier
    transform.  Barbosa et al. [1990] demonstrated that taking the peak 
    of the Z-mode as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the 
    determination of fPE, which concurs with our consistency checks.  
    Thus, in regions where Z-mode is present, we can determine the 
    electron density by either measuring the cutoff of the broadband 
    Z-mode as fL=0 or the peak of the narrow band intense Z-mode as fL=0,
    and using the equations of cold plasma theory.

    When Galileo approaches the lobe of the magnetosphere, the density as
    well as fPE drops precipitously and approaches or even drops below 
    the cyclotron frequency.  Perraut et al. [PERRAUTETAL1998] studied 
    one such case obtained by the Galileo plasma wave instrument.  In 
    order to determine the proper identification of the characteristic 
    frequencies and determine the electron plasma density, we utilize 
    our previous consistency check method.  When an interpretation is 
    found to be consistent with the spectrum, we assume temporal 
    continuity of the cutoffs, and extend the interpretation into 
    regions where a consistency check is not possible due to lack of 
    features in the spectrum or a lack of magnetic field data.  While 
    there is no method for determining the density with certainty in these 
    regions, we believe that assuming that the spectrum does not change
    greatly in a span on the order of minutes is appropriate and 
    suitable to determine the density. 

    Through an extensive analysis of Galileo spectra, there exist three
    possibilities for the interpretation of the low frequency cutoff
    of the emissions in the lobe.  One interpretation, adopted by 
    Perraut et al. [PERRAUTETAL1998], is to label the low frequency 
    cutoff as the electron plasma frequency. This investigation has 
    found numerous time periods when this interpretation is consistent 
    with the spectrum, meaning that the other (calculated) frequencies
    match features present in the spectra.  However, there are
    also a number of time regions where labeling the low frequency 
    cutoff as the L=0 frequency gives calculated frequency values 
    which match the features in the spectrum. 

    Also, there are regions when interpreting the low frequency cutoff 
    as either fPE or fL=0 does not give calculated frequencies which 
    are consistent with the spectrum.  This ambiguity when 
    interpreting spectra cannot be removed at this time, however, we 
    have attempted to systematically evaluate each time region.  

     
  Ancillary Data
  ==============
    None 
  
  
  Coordinate System
  =================
    Included in this data set are two coordinate systems that ensure an
    accurate location of the density data points.  The first system of 
    coordinates consists of distance, longitude and magnetic latitude
    and is referred to commonly as the Jovigraphic coordinate system,
    or one that is fixed to the rotation of the planet. We have used the
    System III Jovigraphic coordinate system which uses the planet's
    magnetic field to measure the rotation. The radial distance is
    defined as the distance from the center of Jupiter to the spacecraft
    (in kilometers) divided by the radius of Jupiter at the equator
    (71492km).  In the usual astronomical convention, the longitude is
    a west longitude which increases with time from an observer above 
    the system, rather than just the angle of rotation about the z-axis.
    
    The other coordinate system included is referred to as the
    Jovicentric Solar Ecliptic (JSE) system. This rotating coordinate
    system has its x-axis point from Jupiter toward the Sun, and its
    y-axis is chosen to be in the ecliptic plane pointing toward dusk 
    (thus opposing planetary motion). Its z-axis is parallel to the
    ecliptic pole. All X, Y, and Z coordinates are measured in Jovian
    radii (1 Rj = 71492km).

    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE                  = "
  
  
  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    There are two important caveats for potential users of these data to
    consider.

    First, this data set was compiled through and shortly after the end of the
    Galileo mission.  The individuals who did the majority of the work are no
    longer available.  A thorough examination of all of the data, comparing
    the digitized frequency with the plasma wave spectrum needs to be carried
    out.

    Second, subsequent to the work on this data set, a detailed examination of
    Voyager wideband spectrogram data was carried out [BARNHARTETAL1998].  The
    Voyager exercise was useful in that it implemented the 'guess-and-check'
    method described above.  Some effort was made to apply this to the Galileo
    data, but the lower spectral resolution of the Galileo survey data means
    that the technique is less useful.

    In short, this data set may suffer from improper spectral interpretation
    and care should be used to consider whether the results are reasonable, or
    not.

    In order to determine the density, we used an analysis tool that  measured
    characteristic frequencies within Galileo plasma wave spectra. This
    frequency detection tool contained both a cutoff and peak detection
    algorithm which could measure either the cutoff or the peak of a spectrum,
    respectively.  For this investigation, only the cutoff algorithm was used.
    Peak detection was made by-hand, meaning an operator manually labeled
    spectrum peaks from individual line plots.  A confidence level was
    recorded for the measured frequency whether it was determined by the
    algorithm or was digitized manually.

    In order to record the confidence of the frequency measurements, data
    quality indices were given to each data point.  The indices range from
    0 to 3 with 0 being a cutoff with the highest confidence and 3 being
    the least. The amount of noise in the spectrum dictates the quality
    rating given to a particular data point.  Points with a minimal amount
    of noise are given values of 0, whereas points where the spectral noise
    is so great that the cutoff is unclear are given a 1 or 2 index
    depending on the severity of the noise.  A data quality index of 3 is
    given when there are obstructions in the spectrum blocking the ability
    for an accurate measurement, or when there is such a significant amount
    of background spectral noise that the spectra must be time-averaged
    over a longer period of time in order to interpret the cutoff.

    A data quality index of 's' was used for regions when Galileo was
    outside the magnetosphere and within the solar wind. The calculated 
    densities are technically not magnetospheric densities but are 
    included in this data set and may be useful for some end-users.   
      
  
  Limitations
  ===========
    Since the low rate electric survey data are collected via sweep frequency 
    spectrum analyzers, the spacing between the frequency bins in the
    receivers represents the ultimate accuracy with which a cutoff can be
    determined.  As described in the PWS_INST.CAT, this spacing is not 
    linear but instead increases with increasing channel center frequency.
    For example the lowest bands of the SFR (Sweep Frequency Receiver) are
    separated by about 3.4 Hz, while the upper bands of the HFR (High
    Frequency Receiver) are separated by over 400,000 Hz.  At any given 
    frequency, the accuracy of a measured cut-off or peak is only known up 
    to the frequency discrimination capability of the receivers themselves.

    Because the electron density is proportional to the square of the plasma
    frequency, the uncertainty in the density expressed as a percentage, is
    twice the spectral resolution delta-f/f expressed as a percentage.
    
    It is important to note that if the plasma frequency is not present
    in the spectrum, the electron plasma density must be calculated
    using another characteristic frequency and the cyclotron frequency,
    which is directly proportional to the local magnetic field.  If 
    magnetic field data do not exist for a region where the plasma 
    frequency cannot be measured, the density can not be determined.
    
    There are a small number of regions containing anomalous magnetic 
    field data which may affect the density calculation.  These magnetic
    field dropouts are sharp, momentary decreases or increases in the 
    magnetic field which are instrumental effects and do not represent 
    realistic occurrences.  They are characterized by a magnetic fluctuation 
    of several orders of magnitude in a span of less than one minute.
    Regions of anomalous magnetic field data which affected density
    measurements were changed manually from their anomalous values to the
    floater value -1 and the subsequent frequency and density calculations
    were changed appropriately.
