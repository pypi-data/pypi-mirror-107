      These data were obtained from running the program HELICOOR in the       
      public directory NSSDCA::ANON_DIR:[ACTIVE.HELIO]. These data are        
      based on predicted trajectories calculated with the GTDS code by the    
      NSSDC Satellite Situation Center and converted to solar ecliptic and    
      heliographic coordinates by the HELIOCOOR program. The HELICOOR code was
      written by R. Parthasarathy. The program GENTRJCON added the HILLON     
      longitude.                                                              
                                                                              
      Note that the solar ecliptic coordinates are given with respect to true 
      equinox and ecliptic of date. The solar ascending node was located at   
      ecliptic longitude +74.367 degrees as of 1 Jan. 1900 at 1200 UT; this   
      longitude increases by 1.4 degrees/century.
