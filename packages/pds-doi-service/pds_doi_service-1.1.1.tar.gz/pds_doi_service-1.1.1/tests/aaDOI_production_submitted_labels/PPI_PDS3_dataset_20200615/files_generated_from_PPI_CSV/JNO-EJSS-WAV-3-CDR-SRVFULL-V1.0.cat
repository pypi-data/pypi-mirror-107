      Data Set Overview
      =================
      The Juno Waves calibrated full resolution survey data set includes all
      low rate science electric spectral densities from 50Hz to 41MHz and
      magnetic spectral densities from 50Hz to 20kHz with complete sweeps at
      30, 10 and 1 second intervals depending on the instrument mode.  This is
      a complete full resolution data set containing all low rate science data
      received from Waves from launch until the end of mission including near
      Earth checkout, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter orbits and all cruise data.
      Data are acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High
      Frequency Receiver (HFR) and are processed into spectra in flight.  
      These data are presented as ASCII text spreadsheets for ease of use.
      This data set is intended to be the most comprehensive and complete data
      set included in the Juno Waves archive.  Pre-rendered spectrograms 
      generated from these data are included as well to lead the user to the
      particular data file(s) of interest.  This data set should be among the
      first used of any in the Waves archive as it will lead one to the
      information required to locate more detailed products. 

      
      Parameters
      ==========
      This data set consists of electric and magnetic field spectral densities
      in the following frequency bands:
      
        Spectral Density    Frequency Range      Receiver, Band
        ----------------   ------------------    ------------------------
        Magnetic            50 Hz  to  20 kHz    LFR, B
        Electric            50 Hz  to  20 kHz    LFR, Lo E
        Electric            19 kHz to 150 kHz    LFR, Hi E
        Electric           133 kHz to   3 MHz    HFR (44 or 45), Baseband
        Electric             3 MHz to  41 MHz    HFR (44 or 45), Hi Bands
        
      The frequency bands are derived from the analysis bandwidths of the Low
      Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High Frequency Receivers (HFR-44, HFR-45).
      The the center frequencies of the bins are roughly log spaced in
      frequency.   The time between frequency sweeps depends on the instrument
      operating mode as follows:
      
        1. Periapsis Cadence    - 1 complete sweep per second
        2. Intermediate Cadence - 1 complete sweep every 10 seconds
        3. Apoapsis Cadence     - 1 complete sweep every 30 seconds

      Additional cadences can be programmed in flight should the science or
      unknown operating constraints dictate.

      Typically electric measurements from 50 Hz to 150 kHz and magnetic
      measurements from 20 kHz to 20 kHz are measured simultaneously,
      however this is not always the case.  Waves has the ability to sample
      solar panel switching noise and to mitigate this noise to a limited
      extent.  When operating in this mode it is not possible to collect all
      data below 150 kHz simultaneously.  In these instances time tags on
      the magnetic data will not line up with time tags on the corresponding
      electric, however in either case timing information in the data files
      are accurate and should be relied upon when processing the data.

      Electric Antenna Length
      -----------------------
      Note that the electric field measurements are calibrated using an
      effective antenna length of 2.41 m based on the geometry of the
      deployed, physical antenna elements.  We caution the user to be aware of
      section 5.1.1 in Kurth et al. (2017) {the Space Science Reviews
      instrument description} in which the effective electrical antenna length
      is 1.46 m based on Sampl et al. (2016).  The reference then mentions the
      additional capacitive divider effect that can reduce this to 0.58 or
      even 0.46 m, depending on the value of the total base capacitance, which
      is not well known. This means that the calibrated electric field 
      strengths could be underestimated by a factor of about 5, or spectral
      densities could be underestimated by a factor of ~25.

      
      Processing
      ==========
      Data products for this data set were generated by the CDR data 
      production pipeline as described in section 3 of the VOLSIS document
      found under the DOCUMENTS sub-directory.  The inputs to the processing
      are:
      
        1. Science and Housekeeping packets from the Waves Level 2 data set.
        2. Calibration tables located on this volume.
        3. NAIF Juno mission SPICE kernels.
        4. A listing of mission phase names and orbit number by UTC.
        
      The result of the processing is one spreadsheet file per frequency band
      per day in which data are available.  
        
      The WAVES_CAL document in the DOCUMENT directory provides details of
      the calibration process.  These data are calibrated using the best
      calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data were
      archived.  Should a significant improvement in calibration become
      available, an erratum will be noted in the erratum section.  Later
      versions of the products may contain better calibrations.
      
      
      Data
      ====
      The Waves calibrated full resolution survey mode data set includes five
      ASCII spreadsheets of wave spectra as a function of time from both the
      upper and lower band of the LFR, the lower band of the HFR as well as 
      the upper spectrum analyzer bands of the HFR.   Each spreadsheet 
      contains a fixed number of fields containing the measurement initiation
      times by spacecraft clock and UTC, a flag to indicate the employment of
      on-board noise mitigation techniques, a flag to indicate whether the
      row is a science measurement or a noise sample spectra, and a flag to
      indicate the presence of burst mode data near the given measurement
      time, as well as one field for each frequency bin.

      Typically electric measurements from 50 Hz to 150 kHz and magnetic
      measurements from 20 kHz to 20 kHz are measured simultaneously,
      however this is not always the case.  Waves has the ability to sample
      solar panel switching noise and to mitigate this noise to a limited
      extent.  When operating in this mode it is not possible to collect all
      data below 150 kHz simultaneously.  In these instances time tags on
      the magnetic data will not line up with time tags on the corresponding
      electric data, however regardless of the operating mode timing
      information in the data files is accurate and should be relied upon when
      processing these data instead of assuming any particular time
      correspondence between receiver bands and sensors.
      
      
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      Ancillary data included with the data set collection include a series
      of files that describe the Waves operating modes as a function of
      time and provide a time-ordered listing of the Instrument Expanded
      Block (IEB) trigger commands (WAV_MAJOR_MODE) (the mode by which Waves
      is reconfigured).  Also a detailed description of each of the modes
      (or IEBs) is provided.
      
      Other data which are ancillary to this data set, but which are archived
      separately from this collection are the Navigation and Ancillary 
      Information Facility's SPICE kernels describing the position and
      attitude of Juno and various solar system bodies as a function of time.
      
      
      Coordinate Systems
      ==================
      The data in this data set are measurements of wave electric and
      magnetic field spectral densities measured by the Waves electric and
      magnetic sensors.  These fields are presented as detected by the sensors
      and are not rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the
      SPICE kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the
      spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in analyzing
      these data.  However, for many purposes, because of the broad beam of
      the dipole-like sensors, the spectral densities are extremely useful and
      may be entirely adequate with no coordinate transformations at all.
      
      
      Software
      ========
      As these data are calibrated and in simple ASCII form, no software is
      provided, and none is required, for conversion or interpretation.
      However the EXTRAS/SOFTWARE directory does contain the viewing tool used
      to generate the BROWSE directory spectrograms.  This tool may be used to
      'zoom in' on regions of interest and to view burst mode data when 
      available.
      
      
      Media/Format
      ============
      This data set is provided to the Planetary Data System electronically
      as part of a volume level 'tarball' file, though the standards for file
      names, directory names and path lengths follow the guidelines provided
      in the 'Planetary Data System Standards Reference', version 3.8, under
      section 10.1.3, 'Specification for Files Delivered Electronically'.

      The 'tarball' file contains all files for a release of this volume in a
      single GNU Tar file that has then been compressed via the GNU gzip
      utility.  The tar file preserves the relative directory path for each
      file so when unpacked the original volume directory structure is
      recreated.  See Section 4 of the VOLSIS for more details on the data
      transfer methods.

      The primary data products are comma separated values (CSV) files.  Since
      this is a survey product, an attempt has been made to group a single
      sweep of all frequency ranges routinely covered by the instrument into
      single rows in the product data files.  In actuality every receiver
      section may be scheduled independently of the others and there are 
      operational modes where it is not possible to include measurements from
      all frequencies with a single row in the product files.

      At Apoapsis Cadence (1 sweep/30 seconds), or Intermediate Cadence
      (1 sweep/10 seconds), one row in the product data files typically
      contains an amplitude measurement for each frequency.  However when 
      operating in one of the Periapsis Cadence modes (~1 sweep/second)
      certain instrument bands will only be sampled once for every two times
      a higher frequency band is covered.  In these cases a single row in the
      data product files may have many empty entries.  This is normal and
      reflects the original collection scheduling.  It is not a transmission
      error nor a processing error.

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      This data set contains all survey mode full resolution calibrated data
      for the Juno Waves instrument for the interval defined by the START_TIME
      and STOP_TIME elements above.  Every effort has been made to ensure that
      all data returned to the ground from the spacecraft are included and
      that the calibration is accurate.  
      
      This section will be updated with information on known issues with the
      data, such as interference from other spacecraft systems, or other
      information needed to use the data with confidence.

      Review
      ======
      The Waves calibrated full resolution survey data will be reviewed
      internally by the Juno Waves team prior to release to the PDS.  The 
      initial release of this data set was also peer reviewed by the PDS.
      
      Data Coverage and Quality
      =========================
      The analog-to-digital converter used for the High Frequency Receiver
      upper channels (above 3 MHz) has an idiosyncrasy caused by an
      oscillation in the chip's reference voltage.  As a result, the converted
      values can deviate from the correct ones by of order 10 data numbers.  
      Hence, the HFR channels above 3 MHz may show quasi-random variations 
      around their correct values when the oscillation is occurring.  
      Since the same converter is used for some housekeeping parameters, some
      of those parameters can be monitored for fluctuations from their nominal
      values as an indicator of this condition.  We have added a flag in the
      QUALITY_FLAGS column of the SURVEY data set to indicate times when we
      suspect this condition is present where the flag value of 1 indicates
      suspect data and a value of 0 indicates the condition is not suspected.
      It is possible for a low-level of this condition to be present in the
      HFR channels without the housekeeping parameters indicating the
      condition.  Experience has shown that resetting the chip can stop or
      reduce the oscillation, hence, such a reset can be performed as a part
      of setting up major modes.  It is planned to do this reset a small
      number of times per Jupiter orbit at major mode changes. 

      The baseband HFR (150 kHz to 3 MHz) has an unidentified temperature-
      dependent noise band which can be seen to move through this range of 
      frequencies as the temperature of Waves varies. Changes in the Waves 
      mode of operation and/or changes in the power state of other vault-
      located equipment have been noted to result in the movement of this 
      band.  Presently, there is no method with which to remove or mitigate
      this noise band. 
      
      Limitations
      ===========
      The Waves instrument collects data samples via three receivers, the
      LFR, HFR-44 and HFR-45.  In addition, each receiver contains different
      analog signal paths for different frequency bands.  Furthermore the 
      electric and magnetic pre-amps have different gains and there are two
      different sensors from which Waves can sample the near space
      environment.  Taken together this constitutes 17 separate analog signal
      pathways that signals may take before being converted to digital data
      values.  Due the the peculiarities of circuit board layout, part 
      selection and necessary design compromises, each path potentially
      exhibits a different sensitivity range.

      The two tables below describe the well-calibrated sensitivity range of
      each analog pathway.  The well-calibrated range is the input amplitude
      region where a proportional change in physical signal amplitude 
      corresponds to a proportional change in Waves output data numbers in
      some well-defined space.  In cases below, proportionality is described
      in either Linear-Log space, or Log-Log space.  Waves data are
      calibrated outside this range, however absolute amplitudes become more
      uncertain the further above or below this range they occur.

      ** The HFR_HI 21 MHz channel picks up noise from the Waves micro-
         processors.  The lower sensitivity bound provided here applies only
         to the 21 MHz channel.  Other channels in the range 15 to 26 MHz have
         a lower noise floor, most likely at about 2.0E-14, but data for these
         noise floors were not collected during ground calibrations.

      Note that the absolute noise floor of certain signal pathways,
      especially those involving the LFR, is below the bottom of the well-
      calibrated range in the chart above.   In most cases this lower end is
      not known precisely from direct measurements.  This is because ambient
      electrical noise in flight is typically much less than the levels seen
      in terrestrial calibration environments.   Histograms of quit cruise
      data provide reasonable estimates of the noise floor of each signal
      pathway.
      
      When viewing the included BROWSE images the archive user should know 
      that calibrations have been applied such that large amplitude signals
      (as expected near Jupiter periapsis) are valid.  However most cruise
      data are near the noise floor of each receiver.  Care must be taken when
      comparing weak signals across receiver bands.  Browse images included 
      on this volume are designed to correspond to the rough sensitivity
