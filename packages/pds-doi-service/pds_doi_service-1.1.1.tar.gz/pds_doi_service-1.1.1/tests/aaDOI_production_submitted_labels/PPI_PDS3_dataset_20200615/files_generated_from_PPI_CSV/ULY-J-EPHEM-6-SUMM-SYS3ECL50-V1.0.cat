      time as viewed by a stationary remote observer.

      Coordinate Transformation Matrices
      ----------------------------------
      The file TRJ25_48.TAB contains all the parameters necessary to
      transform the field components into System III, ECL50, or
      inertial spacecraft coordinates. The paragraphs below give
      methods for computing transformation matrices using these
      parameters. As an alternative, note that the appendix in
      [SMITH&WENZEL1993] contains the orbital elements of Ulysses
      with respect to Jupiter and demonstrates how to calculate the
      position of Ulysses in System III and other coordinate systems
      without recourse to trajectory data files.

      The transformation matrix from R-THETA-PHI to System III
      (1965.0) consists of the column vectors of the R, THETA, and
      PHI axes expressed in System III. The R-axis in System III is
      cos(RLATJG) cos(360-RLONJG), cos(RLATJG) sin(360-RLONJG),
      sin(RLATJG). The PHI axis is the normalized crossproduct J x
      R, where J is the rotation axis which is just 0,0,1, so the
      unit vector in the PHI direction is -sin(360-RLONJG),
      cos(360-RLONJG), 0. The unit vector in the THETA direction is
      the crossproduct PHI x R = sin(RLATJG) cos(360-RLONJG),
      sin(RLATJG) sin(360-RLONJG), -cos(RLATJG).

      The transformation matrix from R-THETA-PHI back to ECL50
      consists of the column vectors of the R, THETA, and PHI axes
      expressed in ECL50. R is cos(RLATEC) cos(RLONEC), cos(RLATEC)
      sin(RLONEC), sin(RLATEC). PHI is the normalized crossproduct
      J x R, where J (North Pole of Jupiter) is given in the
      reference [SMITH&WENZEL1993] as -92.002 RA, 64.504 DEC,
      Earth Mean Equinox and Equator 1950.0. Rotating by 23.4458
      deg (1950.0 obliquity) gives J in ECL50 = (-.015037545, -
      .035534090, 0.999255323). The THETA axis is PHI x R.

      Inertial spacecraft coordinates are defined as follows: Z is
      the Ulysses spin axis, which points approximately towards
      Earth; X is is perpendicular to Z and lies in the plane
      containing Z and S, where S is the Ulysses-to-Sun vector. X is
      positive toward the Sun. Z in ECL50 is cos(AXISLAT)
      cos(AXISLON), cos(AXISLAT) sin(AXISLON), sin(AXISLAT). S in
      ECL50 is -XSU, -YSU, -ZSU. The Y axis is the normalized
      crossproduct Z x S, and the X axis is Y x Z. The
      transformation matrix from ECL50 back to inertial spacecraft
      coordinates consists of the column vectors X, Y, and Z.

      The EPHEM files in this submission include all the parameters
      necessary to calculate the above transformations. In a few
      cases where the direction of the spin axis was not available
      in the SEDR, the Ulysses-to-Earth direction was substituted in
      the EPHEM files. It is suggested that interpolations in time
      be performed on vector components rather than angles in order
      to avoid difficulties near 0 or 360, and that double precision
      arithmetic be used in matrix multiplication."

      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      As noted above, the two versions of Sys 3 ephemeris provided
      contain slightly different values. In the case of R, the
      variation is due to two different definitions of the Jovian
      radius. A value of 1 RJ = 71398 km was used to generate
      TRJ25_48.TAB, and a value of 1 RJ = 71492 km was used for
      SPK25_48.TAB. The reason why latitude and longitude values
      differ is unknown (though possibly due to different
      definitions of the position of Jupiter's magnetic pole, or
      statistical variation).

      The differences in the values contained in the two versions
      are summarized below:

      TRJ25_48.TAB
      ------------
      For the position of Ulysses in Jupiter-centered coordinates,
      1-sigma uncertainties are less than 1 part in 1 million, or
      less than 0.5 km at closest approach.

      The attitude of Ulysses during the Jupiter encounter interval
      is stated to be accurate within +/- 0.005 degrees.

      SPK25_48.TAB
      ------------
      Spacecraft positions were derived from SPICE using software
      that has been extensively tested. They should give as accurate
      representation of spacecraft ephemeris as possible using these
      kernels.

      Comparisons between these data and data from previous Jupiter
      missions should be performed with caution. Some key parameters
      (such as the Jovian radius) have changed from mission to
      mission. Definitions for Jupiter's spin rate and the
      orientation of its spin-axis have also changed slightly since
      the early Pioneer days.

      These data were generated using the current definition of the
      Jovian radius, 71492 km. The spin rate used in generating these
      data is the same as that used for System III (1965), +870.536
      degrees/24 hours."
