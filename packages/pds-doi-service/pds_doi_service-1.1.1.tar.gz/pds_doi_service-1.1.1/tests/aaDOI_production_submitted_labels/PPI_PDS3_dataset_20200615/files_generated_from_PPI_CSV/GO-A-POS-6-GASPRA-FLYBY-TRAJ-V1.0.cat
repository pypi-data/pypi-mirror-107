  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains the Galileo spacecraft trajectory data sampled
    every minutes for Oct. 29 and 30, 1991. The spacecraft closest
    approach to the asteroid was at 22:36:40 at a range of about 1600
    km.  The trajectory data are provided in two coordinate systems,
    Gaspra-centric Solar Ecliptic (GaSE) and Heliographic (HG)
    coordinates. The position of the spacecraft has been extracted from
    the SPICE kernels provided by the project. The time tags are the
    exact times for which the S/C position was calculated. The time tag
    is spacecraft event time (SCET) given in universal time (UT).

  ==================                                                          
    The data are archived in two coordinate systems, GaSE and IHG             
    (1950).  GaSE Gaspracentric Solar Ecliptic (GaSE) is a Gaspra             
    centered coordinate system defined by the primary vector along the        
    instantaneous Gaspra-&#10095;Sun (GSun) line and the Earth's ecliptic north      
    pole (ENP) as the secondary vector. In this coordinate system:            
                                                                              
      X is the GSun unit vector taken to be positive towards the Sun.         
      Y is the formed by the unitized cross product ENP x GSun                
      Z completes the right handed set (Z = X x Y)                            
                                                                              
    such that the X-Z plane contains the ecliptic north pole.                 
                                                                              
    The data are also provided in inertial heliographic (epoch 1950)          
    coordinates. The radial direction is taken along the instantaneous        
    Sun-&#10095;S/C line, positive away from the Sun. Latitude is the angle the      
    radial vector makes with the Sun's equatorial plane at the reference      
    epoch, positive above the equator. Longitude is measured from the         
    longitude of the ascending node.  At the reference epoch, the             
    inclination of the Sun's north pole was 7 deg 15 min and the              
    longitude of the ascending node can be computed using the formula:        
                                                                              
      Node =  74 deg 22 min + 0.84 min (year - 1900)"
