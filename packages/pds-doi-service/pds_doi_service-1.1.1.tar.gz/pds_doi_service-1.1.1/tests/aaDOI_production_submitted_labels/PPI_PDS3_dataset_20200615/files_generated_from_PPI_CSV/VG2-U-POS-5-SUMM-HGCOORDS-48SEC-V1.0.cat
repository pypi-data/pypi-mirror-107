     The Heliographic coordinate system is defined in the reference epoch of  
     1950. The unit vectors which define the coordinate system are as follows:
     X points away from the Sun towards the ascending node, in the            
     solar equatorial plane,                                                  
     Z points along the Sun's spin axis, positive above the equatorial plane, 
     and Y completes the right handed set."
