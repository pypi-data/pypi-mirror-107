     The relationship between thermal ion density and instrument             
     output was established by direct comparison of the O+ signal with       
     the O+ density determined from the Orbiter Ion Mass Spectrometer        
     (OIMS) instrument using O+ data from orbit number 530 at 300            
     seconds from periapsis.  Other species are assumed to have the          
     same sensitivity as that of O+. In this mode superthermal ions          
     cannot be distinguished from thermal ions.                              
                                                                             
     The data reduction process has been described in Kasprzak et al.        
     (1992) but was similar to the technique used for the Superthermal O+    
     ion data. In order to fit the superthermal O+ data, a minimum of 30     
     points were required in 36 seconds. In addition, the maximum to         
     minimum count ratio was required to be factor of 3 or greater in        
     order to insure that there was a definitive spin modulation.  The       
     center 12 seconds of data is divided by the fitting function to         
     derive the equivalent flux for that point. The center of the new        
     fitting interval is adjusted so that it is centered on the expected     
     signal maximum predicted from the previous interval fit. As a result    
     of this method of fitting, discontinuities may exist near minimum       
     angle of attack where one 12 second interval adjoins the next           
     interval.                                                               
                                                                             
     The method used to reduce the data assumes cylindrical                  
     symmetry of the ion source.  In actual fact, the source is              
     asymmetrical in its angular response (Guenther, 1989). This can         
     introduce as much as a factor of 2 scatter in the data. The ion         
     species regularly monitored include: He+, N+, O+, N2+ and/or CO+, NO+   
     and CO2+. As part of the reduction process the minimum ion drift in     
     the ecliptic plane of the apparent ion flow in spacecraft reference     
     frame has been deduced. The density is computed by assuming the ions    
     are thermal energy with a speed equivalent to that of the spacecraft    
     An approximate correction for spacecraft potential has been applied.    
     The data are normalized to the OIMS instrument for O+ and all           
     species are assumed to have the same sensitivity.                       
                                                                             
     Several parameters result from the fit: 1) the best estimate            
     of the density for an approximate 12 second interval (LORES data        
     set); and 2) the phase shift of signal maximum; and 3) the minimum      
     ion drift speed in the ecliptic plane. The phase angle is negative      
     if the predicted signal maximum from the spacecraft velocity is         
     ahead of the true signal maximum when viewed along the -Z               
     spacecraft axis with clockwise rotation.  The drift component is        
     derived from the condition that the total relative velocity in the      
     moving reference frame has no component perpendicular to the (ONMS      
     axis, Z axis) plane.                                                    
                                                                             
     All data were processed at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center             
     using custom programmed software. The software is available.            
     The data represent a reduction to physical units (density, flux)        
     and were processed from an intermediate engineering unit file           
     (current, count/sec etc.). Unit and 1/8 unit amu sweeps are not         
     contained in the processed data sets but are available from the         
     engineering unit data set. The engineering unit data is converted       
     to ambient values using spacecraft velocity and attitude, the           
     theoretical expected system response, and the corresponding             
     calibration factors. Superthermal ion data for species other            
     than O+ is available in engineering unit form.
