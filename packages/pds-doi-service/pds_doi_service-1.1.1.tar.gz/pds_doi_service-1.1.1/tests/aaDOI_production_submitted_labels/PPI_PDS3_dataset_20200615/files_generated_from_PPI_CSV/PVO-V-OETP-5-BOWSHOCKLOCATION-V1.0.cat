The Bow Shock File.  This file gives the orbit-by-orbit times and            
locations of the bow shock crossings, which are characterized by distinct    
changes in Ne.  Multiple shock crossing are listed if they are sufficiently

in the High Resolution Ne File when they occurred within 30 minutes of       
periapsis).                                                                  
                                                                             
The ionopause and bow shock crossing times and locations are easily          
identified in the high resolution Ne measurements (Theis et al., 1980).      
These files contain the UT, altitude, latitude, SZA and local time of each   
crossing.                                                                    
                                                                             
The bow shock is a much more discrete feature in the data than the           
ionopause.  Multiple shock crossings sometimes occur because the shock       
often moves at higher velocities than the satellite. In these cases, only the
outer most shock crossing is recorded, unless the separation between the     
crossings is greater than a minute or two.  The occurrence of multiple       
shocks in the Bow Shock File provides a record of the orbits in which the    
solar wind itself was probably highly variable.  Because of the geometry of  
the orbit, most shock crossings were in the range of 45 to 135 deg. SZA.     
However, the nose region of the shock was explored between 1985 and          
1987 when PVO periapsis was near the equator and was at altitudes            
between 2000 and 2300 km.  During these years near solar minimum the         
nose of the shock often moved down into that altitude range (Russell et al,  
1988).  During the subsolar passages of these years, the orbit               
approximately paralleled the shock, sometimes inside, sometimes outside,     
thus providing interesting snapshots of its movements."

The bow shock is selected from 200 minute pass plots by marking the UT       
of the sharp change in the amplitude of Ne at the shock discontinuity.  The  
resolution of the shock crossing time is of the order of 1 minute on these   
plots, but this could be improved to a few seconds if expanded plots were    
used.  There is no plan currently to provide the ultimate resolution         
available in bow shock crossing time and location."
