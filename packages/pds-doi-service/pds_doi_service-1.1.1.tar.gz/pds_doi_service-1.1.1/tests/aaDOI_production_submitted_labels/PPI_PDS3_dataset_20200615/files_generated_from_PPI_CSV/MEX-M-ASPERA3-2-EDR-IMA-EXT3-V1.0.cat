    =========                                                         
                                                                      
    The Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) provides in situ ion measurements in  
    the energy range 0.01 - 40 keV/q for the main ion components H+,  
    He++, He+, O+, with 20-80 amu/q to help satisfy the following     
    scientific objectives:                                            
                                                                      
       1. Determine the instantaneous global distributions of plasma  
          and neutral gas near Mars by providing undisturbed solar    
          wind parameters                                             
                                                                      
       2. Define the local characteristics of the main plasma regions 
                                                                      
       3. Complement the ENA images                                   
                                                                      
    Parameters:                                                       
    ===========                                                       
                                                                      
    All IMA data products have the same format and parameters, and    
    each row (data file record) in the IMA SPREADSHEET data products  
    has seven (7) COLUMN objects (parameters):                        
       1. Start Time - Begin Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       2. Stop Time - Ending Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       3. Data Type Name - SENSOR or MODE. The SENSOR rows are the    
          IMA science data for each mass channel (32 channels).  The  
          32 SENSOR rows are followed by 10 rows of MODE data for the 
          same time period.  The MODE rows contain informational data 
          such Mask indicators, Indexes, and Summations.              
       4. Data Type Id - Numeric ID indicating SENSOR or MODE.        
       5. Data Name - Short description for data on that row.  For    
          example 'Mass Channel x' where x = 0-31 to indicate the     
          mass channel in the SENSOR rows or 'Polar Angle Index' for  
          informational data (MODE row).                              
       6. Data Unit - Indicates the data unit (c/acc for SENSOR       
          data, unitless for MODE data).                              
       7. Values - These are the actual data values.  For this column 
          there are multiple values as indicated by the ITEMS keyword 
          in the label files.  For IMA data, there are 96 ITEMS.  In  
          the SENSOR rows, these are the science data sampled for     
          each energy step starting at 0 and ending at 95.  The MODE  
          data rows contain only one value each with remaining ITEMS  
          indicated as 'missing' with nothing between the commas      
          (value,,...,,).  Please note that the data values are       
          formatted for best accuracy and that this is not the        
          accuracy of the IMA instrumentation.  In addition, even     
          though the IMA data are in units of c/acc (raw counts)      
          which are typically integer values, the data are formatted  
          with 2-3 decimal places to account for possible fractions   
          that can occur due to onboard data compression and ground   
          data decompression.

    It is important for ASPERA-3 science studies to know where in     
    space and time the Mars Express spacecraft and ASPERA-3           
    instruments are located and what objects (Sun, Mars, Earth,       
    Phobos, Deimos) are in the fields of views. The ASPERA-3 view     
    directions for each sensor can be derived using the SPICE kernels 
    and software. The ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information 
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides a code example (in C    
    and FORTRAN) for determining the view directions for the ASPERA-3 
    sensors.

    The ASPERA-3 data are always in the instrument reference frame    
    since data are sampled in situ. The GEOMETRY table contains       
    spacecraft related parameters expressed in the J2000 reference    
    frame, and the ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information    
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides information for         
    determining the ASPERA-3 sensors view directions and transforming 
    to the J2000 reference frame.

    =======                                                           
                                                                      
    These data have been reviewed by the instrument team and are of   
    the highest quality that can be generated at this time. Science   
    results based on these data have been published in several        
    journals (Science, Nature, EGU, etc.). After submission to the    
    PDS, these data successfully completed the peer review process.   
                                                                      
    Data Coverage/Quality:                                            
    ======================                                            
                                                                      
    IMA cannot measure the positive ions at very low energies and     
    are indicated by negative values for the CENTER_ENERGY for the    
    energy steps affected in the IMA_ENERGYn.TAB files in the CALIB   
    directory.  Data at these energy levels should be ignored and     
    not used.  Also included in the IMA_ENERGYn.TAB files are the     
    elevation angles per polar angle index and per energy step.       
    Elevation angles than -50.0 (degrees) indicate invalid data that  
    should also be excluded from data analysis.                       
                                                                      
    Limitations:

    The ASPERA-3 IMA data is complicated and there are many issues to 
    address when analyzing the data. The IMA_CALIBRATION_REPORT.PDF   
    (in the DOCUMENT directory) addresses many of these issues and it 
    is strongly advised to contact the ASPERA-3 IMA team in guidance  
    in analyzing the IMA data.                                        
                                                                      
 ** Please contact the ASPERA-3 IMA Team for more information before
