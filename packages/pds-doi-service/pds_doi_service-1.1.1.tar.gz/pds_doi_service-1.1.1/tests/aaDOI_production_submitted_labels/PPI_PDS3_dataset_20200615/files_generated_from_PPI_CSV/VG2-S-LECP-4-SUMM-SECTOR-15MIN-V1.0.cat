      This data set consists of resampled data from the Low Energy            
      Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 2 while the               
      spacecraft was in the vicinity of Saturn. This instrument               
      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (&#10095;26 keV          
      electrons and &#10095;30 keV ions) with various levels of                      
      discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular               
      arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are             
      included with this data set. The LECP data are globally                 
      calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are              
      time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact          
      beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the             
      LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods).         
      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular           
      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles          
      that it measures. The cycle time for the rotation is variable,          
      but during encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes.              
      Thus, the full angular anisotropy information is preserved with         
      this data. The data is in the form of 'rate' data which has not         
      been converted to the usual physical units. The reason is that          
      such a conversion would depend on uncertain determinations such         
      as the mass species of the particles and the level of                   
      background. Both mass species and background are generally              
      determined from context during the study of particular regions.         
      To convert 'rate' to  'intensity' for a particular channel one          
      performs the following tasks: 1) Decide on the level of                 
      background contamination and subtract that off the given rate           
      level. Background is to be determined from context and from             
      making use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield             
      covering it). 2) Divide the background corrected rate by the            
      channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the              
      channel. The geometric factor is found in entry                         
      'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_FACTOR' as associated with each channel              
      'CHANNEL_ID'. To determine the energy bandpass, one must                
      judge the mass species of the of the detected particles (for            
      ions but not for electrons). The energy band passes are given           
      in entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and                           
      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and             
      are given in the form 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that               
      begin their names with the designations 'CH' these bandpasses           
      can be used on mass species that are accepted into that                 
      channel (see entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' AND                 
      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which            
      give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these                
      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels            
      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  
      accepted. The and passes for other 'Z' values are not all               
      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       
      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these instructions           
      will be the particle intensity with the units:                          
      counts/(cm^2 str sec keV).

      =========================                                               
      At all times during this planetary encounter there exist data           
      in this data set that can be rated with the highest confidence          
      level. However, some of the channels of data are contaminated           
      by various kinds and various levels of contaminations. It is            
      therefore imperative, in using this data set, that the                  
      contamination tables within the catalog be examined. Also, not          
      all kinds of contamination have been fully documented. When in          
      doubt the data supplier must be contacted.                              
                                                                              
      Some channels are subject to serious contaminations, and many           
      of these contaminations cannot be removed except with a region-         
      by-region analysis, which has not been done for this data.              
      Thus, to use this data it is absolutely vital that the                  
      contamination types ('CONTAMINATION_ID' , 'CONTAMINATION_DESC')         
      and the levels of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID'                      
      corresponding to the definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be                
      carefully examined for all regions of study. A dead time                
      correction procedure has been applied in an attempt to correct          
      the linear effects of detector overdrive (pulse-pileup). This           
      procedure does not fix severely overdriven detectors. A                 
      procedure is available for correcting Voyager 2 LECP electron           
      contamination of low energy ion channels, but its effectiveness         
      has been evaluated only for the Uranus data set. Thus,                  
      corrections have been applied only to the Uranus data set.

       -1: affected data is unrated with regard to contamination type         
        0: affected data is uncontaminated by contamination type              
        1: affected data is marginally contaminated by contamination          
           type                                                               
        2: affected data is seriously contaminated by a contamination         
           type, but the measurement is probably retrievable                  
        3: affected data is seriously contaminated by contamination           
           type, and the retrievability of the measurement is                 
           questionable                                                       
        4: affected data is so contaminated by contamination type             
           that the measurement cannot be retrieved                           
                                                                              
      Data Quality Desc                                                       
      -----------------                                                       
        1: Ion channels penetrating background. All ion channels are          
           subject to background due to high energy particles that            
           penetrate detector shielding. Channels that are the result         
           of 'particle multiple parameters' measurements are less            
           subject to such contamination (channels 'CH__'). A crude           
           quality parameter has been derived from the ratio of the           
           shielded and unshielded 53 to 85 keV 'pl01' ion channel.           
           All other channels must be judged independently from               
           context and from a corresponding ratio. No corrections             
           have been applied.                                                 
        2: Solar UV. When the lowest energy ion and electron                  
           detectors (electron detector less affected) face the sun           
           (sector 1) substantial background counts can occur in the          
           lowest (pl01) and (somewhat) next to lowest (pl02) ion             
           channels. A very crude quality parameter is derived from           
           the ratio of the sun-facing and adjacent sector for the            
           pl01 channel.  This parameter should not be accepted as            
           the last word but should be only used for guidance, and it         
           can be misleading. Electrons must be judged separately. No         
           corrections have been applied.                                     
        3: Ion channel electron contamination. The lowest energy ion          
           channels (pl01 through pl05) are subject to contamination          
           from &#10095; 400 keV electrons which penetrate the magnetic              
           shielding. This condition is well diagnosed on Voyager 2           
           but not on Voyager 1. Context, corresponding Voyager 2             
           measurements, and the correlation between moderate energy          
           electron channels and these ion channels must be use to            
           diagnose this condition for Voyager 1. A correction has            
           been applied only to the Voyager 2 Uranus data.                    
        4: Ion detector overdrive. If the fluxes striking a detector          
           is too high, the output of that detector becomes anomalous         
           due to pulse pileup (linear effects) and baseline                  
           restoration (non-linear effects) problems. All detectors           
           are subject to possible problems. A crude quality                  
           parameter has been derived based on the total rate                 
           striking the detector that measures the lowest energy ions         
           (pl01-pl08). Pl01-5 are the channels most strongly affected,       
           with the greatest effects occurring for the lowest energy          
           channels. A dead-time correction procedure has been applied        
           to the data to help alleviate the less severe problems.            
        5: Detector noise. The detector/electronics noise for the             
           lowest energy detectors (ions in particular) is not too            
           far below the lowest energy discrimination levels. That            
           noise can appear as background counts in the lowest energy         
           channels if the detector noise increases as a result of            
           the detector being overdriven, etc. The lowest                     
           discrimination can be adjusted by ground command to help           
           alleviate this problem. A crude quality parameter has been         
           derived based on reasonable/unreasonable ratios of the ion         
           channels pl01 and pl02. This parameter should be used only         
           as a rough guide and can be misleading. No correction has          
           been applied.                                                      
        6: Electron channels penetrating background. All electron             
           channels are subject to background due to high energy              
           particles that penetrate detector shielding. A crude               
           quality parameter has been derived based on the ratio of           
           the shielded and unshielded 37 to 70 keV 'eb02' electron           
           channel. All other channels must be judged independently           
           from context and from a corresponding ratio. No correction         
           has been applied.                                                  
        7: Electron detector overdrive. If the fluxes striking a              
           detector is too high, the output of that detector becomes          
           anomalous due to pulse pileup (linear effects) and                 
           baseline restoration (non-linear effects) problems. All            
           detectors are subject to possible problems. A crude                
           quality parameter has been derived based on the total rate         
           striking the detector that measures the lowest energy              
           electrons (eb01-eb05). The greatest effects occur for the          
           lowest energy channels. A dead-time correction procedure           
           has been applied to the data to help alleviate less severe         
           problems.                                                          
        8: Miscellaneous bad data spikes. There are 'spikes' in the           
           data processed for this instrument due to telemetry                
           problems and other processing problems. Their are routines         
           to eliminate these spikes, however, sometimes real events          
           (fast changing) are also eliminated. We have chosen to             
           leave the spikes in and to eliminate them when needed from         
           context."
