      =================                                                      
      This data set contains magnetic-field data acquired during the         
      cruise and tour phases of the Cassini mission to Saturn.               
      On 16 August, 1999 two days before the spacecraft commenced Earth      
      swingby, the magnetometer boom was unfurled into its extended          
      position; a  configuration it maintained for the remainder of the      
      mission.  Magnetic-field data acquired prior to boom deployment are    
      limited and are significantly affected by spacecraft noise. These      
      data are of no scientific value and, consequently, do not form part    
      of this data set.                                                      
                                                                             
      Cassini carried two magnetometers: a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)       
      and a vector-helium magnetometer capable of operating in both          
      vector and scalar mode (V/SHM). This data set contains calibrated,     
      and averaged magnetic-field data recorded by the FGM instrument.       
      The data are provided in both 1 second. The 1 second averaged data     
      files span 1 quarter of year prior to arrival at Saturn, and 1 Saturn  
      orbit following arrival at Saturn. The data are provided in RTN        
      coordinates throughout the mission. After arrival at Saturn, the       
      Saturn-centered KRTP, KSO, and KSM coordinates are also provided.      
      Earth-centered, and Jupiter-centered coordinates are provided for      
      the flybys of those two planets. All data files are ASCII.             
                                                                             
      These data were calibrated, and rotated into geophysical coordinates   
      by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial College (IC), and provided to      
      the PDS/PPI node via the Cassini MAG team Co-I at UCLA. In other       
      words these data use the same calibration as the data routinely        
      delivered to the Cassini MAG team. Averaging for the 1 second data     
      was performed at the PDS-PPI Node.

      The coordinate systems in which the data are provided in vary by       
      mission phase, and are designed to support both solar wind and         
      planetary magnetospheric studies.

         RTN coordinates consist of R (radial component, Sun to the          
         spacecraft), T (tangential component, parallel to the Solar         
         Equatorial plane and perpendicular to R), and N (normal component,  
         completes right handed set).

         KRTP magnetic field vector components form the standard right-handed
         spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a planet-centered system.       
         Namely, R is radial (along the line from the center of Saturn to the
         center of the spacecraft), and positive away from Saturn. Phi, the  
         azimuthal component, is parallel to the Kronographic equator (Omega 
         x R) and positive in the direction of corotation. Theta, the        
         'southward' component, completes the right-handed set.

      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 1 data were calibrated at the PDS/PPI node at       
      UCLA using software (CAL02), and calibration data provided by the      
      Cassini MAG team. The process used the same calibration data that      
      was provided with the Raw Magnetometer data archive (Data Set ID:      
      CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0). The data were then rotated      
      into geophysical coordinates using MAG team additonal MAG team         
      provided code (TRANSCAL) and spice kernels obtained from NAIF.         
      The data were then averaged, and reformatted to ASCII using code       
      developed at PDS/PPI.                                                  
                                                                             
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 2 data were calibrated, and rotated into            
      geophysical coordinates by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial            
      College, and provided to the PDS/PPI node via the MAG team Co-I at     
      UCLA. Averaging to 1 second was performed at PDS/PPI (UCLA). The       
      data were then reformatted at PDS/PPI to match the format used for     
      the version 1 data.                                                    
                                                                             
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 3 have followed the same path as the version 2      
      data, however, the data have been recalibrated.                        
                                                                             
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 4 data were processed following the same            
      procedure that was followed for the version 2 data. However,           
      previously undetected mis-time tagged data which were present in       
      the full-resolution data were removed prior to averaging the data      
      to 1 second. More details on the timing errors are provided in the     
      confidence level note (below).                                         
                                                                             
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 5 data were processed following the same            
      procedure that was followed for the version 4 data, including the      
      removal of mis-timed data before averaging. In addition, version 5     
      products have been modified to satisfy liens set in the PDS peer       
      review. Including a change in record formatting, and changes to        
      the PDS labels.
