      This data set consists of Voyager 2 Saturn encounter ephemeris data     
      in Kronographic (L1) coordinates covering the period 1981-08-23 to      
      1981-08-29. Two versions, both covering the same time period, but       
      containing slightly different data, are provided. One version was       
      generated by the Voyager MAG team from Voyager 2 SEDR, the other        
      by the PDS/PPI node using the VG2_SAT.TSP and PCK00006.TPC SPICE

      Due to inaccuracies in Voyager SEDR, as well as changes in the          
      values of some key parameters (e.g. Saturnian radius) the timing        
      is improved for the SPICE generated data. However, since much           
      of the original analysis was based upon the SEDR generated              
      ephemeris, this data has been included as well.

      The Kronographic (L1) coordinates is a Saturn centered spherical        
      system, based on the Saturn Longitude System (Voyager Measurements      
      of the Rotation Period of Saturn's Magnetic Field, Desch and Kaiser,    
      JGR, 8, 253, 1981).  In this coordinate syatem, longitude increases     
      with time as viewed by a stationary remote observer.

      The SPICE generated data were derived from SPICE using                  
      software that has been extensively tested. They should give as          
      accurate representation of spacecraft ephemeris as possible             
      using these kernels.                                                    
                                                                              
      Comparisons between these data and other data from previous             
      Saturn missions should be performed with caution. Some key              
      parameters, such as the Saturnian radius, have changed from             
      mission to mission. Definitions for Saturn's spin rate and              
      the orientation of its spin-axis have also changed slightly             
      since the early Pioneer days.
