    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe          
    Sweep voltage-current data set comprises calibrated                      
    Voltage-Current (U-I) characteristics acquired almost continuously       
    from most mission  phases during the entire Cassini mission.  This       
    particular data set includes spacecraft event time, bias voltage,        
    and measured current for each sampled data point.  Data are              
    presented in tables organised so as to have fixed-length records         
    for ease in data handling.  These can be used to derive higher           
    level data products like thermal plasma parameters, e.g., electron       
    density and temperature.                                                 
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Parameters                                                                 
  ==========                                                                 
    This data set comprises spacecraft event time, bias voltage, and         
    measured  current for each sampled data point that was acquired by       
    the RPWS.                                                                
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Processing                                                                 
  ==========                                                                 
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets then de-compress the data           
    that were compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms        
    by the RPWS flight software onboard. The conversion from telemetry       
    data to physical measured electric current units is made through         
    lookup tables created by two 3rd order polynomial fits to the            
    ground tests calibration data. The ground test calibration data          
    are presented in Chapter 9 of the  RPWSCAL document in the               
    DOCUMENT directory.  These data are calibrated using the best            
    calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data         
    were archived.                                                           
                                                                             
    The sweep data themselves consist of 0.5s long current-voltage           
    characteristics consisting of 512 or 1024 samples each. The sweeps       
    are usually made every 24s during targeted moon flybys or during         
    inner magnetosphere crossings, or every 600s during survey mode.         
    The bias voltage sweep range is most often between +/-32V, except        
    for Titan flybys below 1200km altitude where the voltage range  is       
    +/-4V.  The voltage sweeps are usually swept from both negative          
    and positive voltage bias (i.e., two sweeps occur per 0.5s) to           
    check for hysteresis artefacts.  Some of the sweep data show data        
    spikes of external interference origin. These have not been              
    corrected for, but  can easily be filtered away by the user.             
                                                                             
    There are several literature references regarding how to do              
    analyse Langmuir probe sweeps, and the following references,             
    specific for  the RPWS Langmuir probe analysis, are probably

    Ancillary data archived separately with volume set id                    
    USA_NASA_PDS_CORPWS_0XXX include a series of files that describe         
    the modes of the RPWS as a function of time and provide a                
    time-ordered listing of Instrument Expanded Block (IEB) trigger          
    commands (the mode by which the RPWS is reconfigured). Also a            
    detailed description of each of the modes (or IEBs) is provided.         
                                                                             
    Other data which are ancillary to this data set and which are            
    archived separately from this collection are the Navigation and

    The data in this data set are calibrated Voltage-Current                 
    characteristics measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe. These data          
    are presented as detected by the sensor and are not rotated into         
    any other coordinate system.  If desired, the SPICE kernels can be       
    used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the spacecraft frame         
    to virtually any frame which may be of use in analysing these            
    data.  However, for most  purposes, the data may be considered           
    point measurements at Cassini (a Langmuir probe Voltage sweep is         
    at most 0.5s long) and may be entirely adequate with no coordinate       
    transformations at all.  However, for analysis purposes using this       
    data set, the photo-electron cloud around the spacecraft, the            
    photo-electron emission from the Langmuir probe itself, as well as       
    possible ram plasma wake effects will indeed depend on the               
    orientation of the spacecraft versus the solar and plasma ram flow       
    directions.

  =========================                                                  
    This data set contains calibrated Voltage-Current characteristics        
    acquired by the Cassini RPWS Langmuir probe for the interval             
    described below. Every effort has been made to ensure that all           
    data returned to JPL from the spacecraft is included and that the        
    calibration is accurate. The noise level of the Langmuir probe is        
    estimated to be close to 100 pA derived from the sampled current         
    data for negative bias voltage in thin plasma regions (&#10094;0.1              
    cm**-3).  Calibration and other systematic errors are smaller than       
    the noise level.  In micro-meter sized dust regions the individual       
    dust hits  can be seen as spikes in the voltage sweep data.  These       
    have not been corrected for since it contains potential science          
    results.  Furthermore, some of the sweep data show artificial data       
    spikes of external interference origin. These have not been              
    corrected either, but can easily be filtered away by the user.           
    Wake effects may also affect the quality of the data if the probe        
    is in the wake of the spacecraft.  The voltage-current                   
    characteristics data set has otherwise a very good confidence            
    level.

    The RPWS Langmuir probe sweep calibrated data will be reviewed           
    internally by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS.         
    The data set will also be peer reviewed by the PDS.                      
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data Coverage and Quality                                                  
  =========================                                                  
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our         
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general,           
    the  RPWS/LP instrument started to operate just after launch in          
    1997, thereafter with intermittent operation periods near Earth          
    and Jupiter flybys until three months before Saturn Orbit                
    Insertion (SOI).  The RPWS/LP was thereafter operated more or less       
    continuously from SOI and forward, and gave higher resolution data       
    during each moon flyby.  Data gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly         
    resolution or simply to downlink gaps, some of which were imposed        
    by limitations on DSN station availability.                              
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps has an interference        
    in individual sweep samples. The RPWS HFR receiver give these            
    interference signals in the LPR in certain negative bias voltage         
    ranges.  These samples can been easily filtered away before              
    analysis and should not pose a problem for the user analysis that        
    deliver output parameters.  The user will find out that thermal          
    electron output data will usually not be available, due to               
    spacecraft photoelectron current contamination, for number               
    densities below 1 cm**-3 and/or for temperatures above 10eV. The         
    thermal ion ram current is usually not detectable below 5-10             
    cm**-3.  Derived electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be            
    regarded as uncertain, as the rms electric field surface                 
    variability of the spherical TiN coated probes is 0.015eV, and the       
    number of sweep samples used for the temperature estimation              
    becomes small (4-5 samples out of 1024 samples over +/-4V).
