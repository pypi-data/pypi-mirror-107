      Electron density: A derived parameter equaling the number of            
      electrons per unit volume over a specified range of electron            
      energy. Different forms of electron density are derived                 
      distinguished by method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of        
      moments) or by the some selection criteria (i.e., hot electron          
      and cold electron density). In general, if more than one electron       
      component is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density         
      will be provided which is the sum of the electron densities. If         
      the electron do not have a Maxwellian distribution the actual           
      distribution can be represented as the sum of several Maxwellians,      
      in which case the density of each Maxwellian is given.

      Electron temperature: A derived parameter giving an indication of       
      the mean energy/electron, assuming the shape of the electron            
      energy spectrum to be Maxwellian (i.e. highest entropy shape).          
      Given that the electron energy spectrum is not exactly Maxwellian,      
      the electron temperature can be defined integrally (whereby the         
      mean energy obtained by integrating under the actual electron           
      energy spectrum is set equal to the integral under a Maxwellian,        
      where the temperature is a free parameter for which to solve), or       
      differentially (whereby the slopes of the actually electron energy      
      spectrum at various energies are matched to the slopes of a             
      corresponding Maxwellian). The temperature parameter is often           
      qualified with a range of applicable energies. Temperatures can be      
      angularly anisotropic. If the electrons do not have a Maxwellian        
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the sum      
      of several Maxwellians, each with a separate temperature.

    ------------------                                                        
      Electron Rate: A measured parameter equaling the number of              
      electrons hitting a particle detector per specified accumulation        
      interval. The counted electrons may or may not be discriminated as      
      to their energies (e.g. greater than E1, or between E1 and E2).         
                                                                              
      Electron Current: A measured parameter equaling the rate at which       
      negative charge is collected by a particle detector. The electrons      
      contributing to this current may be restricted by energy.               
      Electrons always have a charge of 1, so this quantity corresponds       
      directly to the electron rate.

    The electron parameters are reliable except near closest approach         
    where the electrons are cold. In the time period between 237.03180        
    and 237.11253, the cold component is below the threshold the PLS          
    measurement.  A temperature of 3 eV is assumed for the cold               
    component.  The spacecraft potential is not determined and is set         
    equal to zero.  The parameters of the hot electron components are         
    obtained directly from the fits and are reliable.  The cold               
    electron density is set equal to the total ion density minus the          
    hot electron density.  In this region the results have large              
    error bars.

  =========================                                                   
    In the time period from 1989-08-24T14:38:04.130 (236.60977) to            
    1989-08-24T19:45:17.571 (236.82312), when the spacecraft is in the        
    inbound magnetosheath and is probably positively charged, a               
    program written by Sittler (1987) is used to derive the electron          
    density and temperature.                                                  
    The spacecraft potential is calculated by using Scudder's (1981)          
    return current-spacecraft potential relation.  Estimates of the           
    formal errors are not performed in Sittler's program.  Since the          
    electrons are hot in this region, we are confident of the results.        
                                                                              
    In the time periods from                                                  
    1989-08-24T22:46:35.334 (236.94902) to                                    
    1989-08-24T23:32:12.481 (236.98070)                                       
    and from

    1989-08-25T09:23:24.001 (237.39125),                                      
    when the spacecraft is in hot plasma regions, all the electron            
    parameters are derived from fits to the electron spectra.  Again,         
    we are confident of the results.                                          
                                                                              
    In the regions where a cold electron component is present in the          
    spectra                                                                   
    (1989-08-24T23:35:23.424 (236.98291) to                                   
    1989-08-25T00:35:23.712 (237.02458)                                       
    and from                                                                  
    1989-08-25T04:33:48.095 (237.19014) to                                    
    1989-08-25T08:02:35.233 (237.33513), the                                  
    spacecraft is negatively charged and the density calculation is           
    seriously affected by spacecraft charging.  The total ion density         
    from the PLS ion measurements and the condition of charge                 
    neutrality are used to estimate the spacecraft potential.  The true       
    density of each electron component is equal to d0*exp(-Vsc/T),            
    where d0 is the density from the fits assuming a zero spacecraft          
    potential, Vsc is the spacecraft potential and T is the temperature       
    of that component.  Uncertainties in the electron density should          
    thus mainly determined by the ion density calculation.  However,          
    electron temperature calculations are not affected by the                 
    spacecraft charging, so they are quite accurate.                          
                                                                              
    In the time period from                                                   
    1989-08-25T00:45:47.520 (237.03180) to                                    
    1989-08-25T02:42:02.592 (237.11253),                                      
    the cold component is below the threshold the PLS measurement. A          
    temperature of 3 eV is assumed for the cold component. The                
    spacecraft potential is not available, so is set equal to zero.           
    The parameters of the hot electron components are obtained directly       
    from the fits.  The cold electron density is then set equal to the        
    total ion density minus the hot electron density.  In this region         
    the results have large error bars.                                        
                                                                              
    In the region near closest approach                                       
    (1989-08-25T04:11:23.712 (237.17458) to                                   
     1989-08-25T04:25:34.752 (237.18443),                                     
    where the loss-cone effect is prominent,  the density of each             
    component is equal to d0*ditot/detot, where d0 is the density of          
    the component calculated from the fits, ditot is the total ion            
    density, detot is the total electron density from the fits.
