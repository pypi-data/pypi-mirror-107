      This dataset contains Voyager 2 spacecraft position vectors relative    
      to Uranus in minus U1 coordinates.  The U1 or Uranus West Longitude     
      System coordinate system is a planetocentric system fixed to Uranus     
      which is rotating with a 17.24 hour period.                             
                                                                              
      The prime meridian of the this system is defined such that at           
      1986-01-24T18:00:00.000 the Voyager 2 spacecraft was at 302             
      degrees west longitude (58 degrees east longitude).                     
                                                                              
      For the PDS archive dataset, the original data archive has been         
      converted to an east longitude (righthanded) coordinate                 
      system minus U1 (-U1). This is achieved by subtracting the              
      U1 longitude from 360.0 degrees. The data are provided in units         
      of Uranian radii which was taken to be 25,600km by the Voyager          
      project. Angles are given in degrees. Both cartesian and spherical      
      coordinates are provided.                                               
                                                                              
      The Cartesian coordinate system is defined as follows:                  
      - X lies in the equatorial plane of Uranus, positive away from the      
      planet, and through the prime meridian at the reference epoch.          
      - Z is parallel to the Uranus spin axis, positive in the southern       
          hemisphere in ecliptic (orbital) coordinates, and,                  
      - Y is Z x X (righthanded)                                              
                                                                              
      The Cartesian coordinate system does not rotate with the planet.
