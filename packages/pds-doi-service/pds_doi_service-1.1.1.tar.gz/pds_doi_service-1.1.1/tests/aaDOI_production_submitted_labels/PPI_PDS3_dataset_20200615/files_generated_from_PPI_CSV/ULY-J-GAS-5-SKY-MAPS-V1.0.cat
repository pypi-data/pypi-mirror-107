      Data Set Overview                                                      
      =================                                                      
      The GAS-Instrument on ULYSSES provides angular distributions           
      of count rates from interstellar helium particles (in the              
      NG-mode) or from celestial UV-intensities (UV-mode).                   
                                                                             
      Therefore the data are presented in the form of maps rather            
      than as time series (as for most other ULYSSES experiments).           
                                                                             
      The intensities are mapped in an ecliptic coordinate system            
      centered in the spacecraft. In this system, the positions of           
      the Sun and the planets vary with time and with the position           
      of the spacecraft along its trajectory, however, the positions         
      of stars remain fixed. The actual positions of Sun, Earth, and         
      Jupiter are indicated by yellow, green and white dots,                 
      respectively. The area around the Sun is excluded from                 
      observation to avoid damaging intensities from direct                  
      sunlight.                                                              
                                                                             
      The intensities obtained in the UV-mode (the housekeeping              
      parameter HV given in the bottom line of each map, has a               
      positive value) are color coded in the range 10...1000                 
      counts/s, in the NG-mode (HV has a negative value) in the              
      range 0.1...10 counts/s.

      Interstellar Gas (NG-mode):                                            
                                                                             
      Most of these maps are restricted to an area around the                
      apparent flow direction of the interstellar helium particles.          
                                                                             
      It is important to note, that the locally observed, apparent           
      flow direction deviates from the flow direction at large               
      distances (outside the solar system) for two reasons:                  
      1.) The local flow direction results from a deflection of the          
          asymptotic direction due to the solar gravity (hyperbolic          
          orbits).                                                           
      2.) The observed, apparent flow direction deviates from the            
          local flow direction due to the aberration effect,                 
          resulting from a combination of the particle velocity              
          vector and the spacecraft velocity vector. This effect is          
          significant (of the order of 10 degrees) as the                    
          spacecrafts velocity is of the same order as the particle          
          velocity (several 10 km/s).                                        
                                                                             
      The systematic variation in the flow intensity which can be            
      observed during over extended periodes in the ULYSSES mission          
      is a result of the variation of the relative energy of the             
      particles in the instrument's system. The detection efficiency         
      of helium particles is strongly energy dependent with a sharp          
      cut-off at energy around 30 eV (equivalent to a velocity of            
      about 30 km/s for helium particles). This threshold is only            
      exceeded when the spacecraft velocity (in magnitude and                
      direction) adds in a favourable way to the local particle              
      velocity. This is the case during extended periodes of the             
      ULYSSES mission, from launch to Jupiter fly-by (Nov. 1990 to           
      Feb. 1992) and in periods before and after perihelion (July            
      1994 to July 96 and again in 1999 to 2001).                            
                                                                             
      Due to a residual sensitivity of the instrument to UV-photons,         
      even in the NG-mode, also the signal from UV-stars is                  
      registered. This has been used to verify the pointing accuracy         
      of the instrument to be of the order to a few tenths of a              
      degree.

      Close to Jupiter, in January to April 1992, the integral               
      fluxes of low energy neutral particles can be derived from the         
      observation of their angular distributions.
