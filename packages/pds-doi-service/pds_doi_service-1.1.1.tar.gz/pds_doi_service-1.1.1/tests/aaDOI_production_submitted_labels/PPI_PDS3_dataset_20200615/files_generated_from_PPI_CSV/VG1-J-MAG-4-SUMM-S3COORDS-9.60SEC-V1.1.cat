    =================                                                        
                                                                             
    This data set includes calibrated magnetic field data acquired by        
    the Voyager 1 Low Field Magnetometer (LFM) during the Jupiter            
    encounter. Coverage begins in the solar wind inbound to Jupiter and      
    continues past the last outbound bowshock crossing. The data are in      
    System III (1965) (SYS3) coordinates and have been averaged from the     
    1.92 second summary data to a 9.6 second sample rate. All magnetic       
    field measurements are given in nanoTesla (nT). The magnetic field       
    data are calibrated (see the calibration description included in the     
    Voyager 1 Magnetometer instrument catalog file for details).             
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Parameters                                                               
    ==========                                                               
                                                                             
    The full LFM instrument sample rate is 1 sample per 0.06 seconds.        
    Full telemetry resolution 'detail' data must be obtained from the        
    instrument team. For this data set, the data have been resampled to      
    9.6 seconds from 1.92 second summary data. The 1.92 second data were     
    in turn resampled from the detail data.                                  
                                                                             
    The LFM has eight dynamic ranges. The instrument is designed switch      
    between dynamic ranges automatically depending upon the observed         
    magnetic field magnitude and fluctuations. Instrument digitization       
    uncertainty depends upon dynamic range as indicated in the following     
    table (from [BEHANNONETAL1977]).

    Counts are measured onboard using 12 bit words that may represent        
    values ranging from 0-4096. Integer counts are converted to magnetic     
    field units (gammas) by subtracting a zero offset, from the measured     
    MAG value and multiplying this difference by the sensitivity of the      
    instrument.
