  The Pioneer Venus Orbiter Retarding Potential Analyzer RDR data            
  set is an essentially raw instrument data form which has been              
  reformatted to facilitate analysis using a Least Squares Fit (LSF)         
  technique for determining plasma parameters.  The data set contains        
  individual instrument 'sweeps' or Current/Voltage segments (I/V            
  curves), packaged with instrument status information (mode, data           
  quality, etc.) and spacecraft ephemeris data that has been extracted       
  from the SEDR. The data set covers the entire range of orbital             
  operations (orbits 1-5055) and spans the time period 1978-12-05            
  through 1992-10-07.

  ==============                                                             
                                                                             
  Each orbit file consists of a file header table (one record)               
  followed by groups of data (tables), each group representing a             
  sweep. Each sweep section is furtherdivided into its header (one           
  record table), a header for the data (one record table which tells         
  how many records of data there will be), the data (table), the             
  first and last data (two record table), a header for the SEDR              
  data (one record table which tells how many records of SEDR data           
  there will be), and the SEDR data (table).                                 
                                                                             
  The PDS standards do not accomodate the labeling of variable record        
  data structures. All ORPA-RDR data files are described by a detched        
  'minimum' PDS label

  periapsis time, file records, start time, and stop times for each          
  orbit. The SWEEP.IDX file provides detailed information including
