      The Science Packet data product includes one record per                
      instrument integration period.  The integration period, at full        
      telemetry rate, is 31 ms with samples collected at a 34 ms             
      cadence. When telemetry bandwidth is limited, measurements are         
      accumulated by the instrument software prior to construction of        
      the telemetry packet. In this case the integration period is           
      equal to the number of measurements accumulated to form the            
      telemetry packet times the basic 31 ms integration                     
      period. Parameters in the file include packet identification,          
      instrument state and status, and 68 counter values for the low

      Prior to SOI the INMS instrument was evacuated and the aperture        
      was closed by a cover installed prior to launch. The instrument        
      was operated during in-flight check-outs (ICO) collecting              
      baseline calibration data. During the approach science phase,          
      INMS was operated nearly continuously to obtain operational            
      experience and to validated data collection tables. Data is available

      INMS science data collection began at SOI. From SOI onwards, the       
      instrument was essentially in continuous operation.                    
                                                                             
      An issue with velocity compensation exists from launch through         
      2005-058 which results in differences between the flight               
      software computed quad lens bias voltages and ground computed          
      values for the same velocity. This issue results in signal level       
      changes when switching between velocity compensated scans and          
      energy scans with ground computed quad lens voltages. The issue        
      is resolved in data collected after TBS-DATE by correcting the         
      ground computation of lens bias voltages.                              
                                                                             
      Prior to 2005-058 the flight software velocity compensation            
      algorithm clipped only the lens voltage that reached its limit,        
      allowing the other three voltages to be adjusted. This resulted        
      in the voltages failing to maintain their proper relation-             
      ships. This was corrected by insuring that once one                    
      voltage reached its limit, all four voltages were frozen.              
                                                                             
      The spacecraft background command sequence was halted on 2004-185      
      and it was resumed on 2004-194. During this period, housekeeping       
      data was produced on all days but day 2004-191.                        
                                                                             
      During the period from 2005-007 through 2005-014, the instrument       
      was shut down while the Probe mission occurred. No packet data         
      was produced during this period.                                       
                                                                             
      During the period from 2005-015 through 2005-021, only realtime        
      housekeeping data was produced, no SCI packets were recorded           
      on board while waiting for the Probe mission data to be validated.     
                                                                             
      During S31 (from 2007-182), S32, S33, and S34 (to 2007-273) data gaps  
      of more than one day occurred on days 255, 256, and 257 resulting in   
      the PKT file being absent from the data for those days. These gaps were
      the result of spacecraft safing.                                       
                                                                             
      During S48 (from 2009-091), S49, S50, S51 (to 2009-181) data gaps      
      of more than one day occurred on day 124 resulting in                  
      the PKT file being absent from the data for those days. These gaps were
      the result of a Deep Space Network station breakdown.                  
                                                                             
      During S56 (from 2010-001), S57, S58 (to 2010-090) data gaps           
      of more than one day occurred on days 003, 004, and 005 resulting in   
      the PKT file being absent from the data for those days. These gaps were
      the result of the instrument being turned Off because of an SSPS       
      Trip on the spacecraft.                                                
                                                                             
      During S63 (from 2010-274), S64, S65 (to 2010-365) data gaps           
      of more than one day occurred on days 307-318 resulting in             
      the PKT file being absent from the data for those days. These gaps were
      the result of the instrument being turned Off because of a             
      spacecraft safing event.                                               
                                                                             
      During S75, data gaps of more than one day occurred on days            
      2013-294 through 2013-302 resulting in the PKT file being absent from  
      the data for those days.  These gaps were the result of the instrument 
      being turned off during the Cassini Propellant Gauge Test.             
                                                                             
      During S83 (from 2014-091) and S84 (to 2014-181) a data gap of more    
      than one day occurred on day 128 resulting in the PKT file being absent
      from the data for that day. This gap was the result of telemetry gaps. 
                                                                             
      During S92 (from 2016-001), the data gap on day 021 was a result of an 
      end of mission downlink test which resulted in the PKT file being      
      absent from the data for that day.                                     
                                                                             
      During S101 (from 2017-191), the data gap on day 208, 209, and 231 were
      the result of putting the instrument to sleep for table loads for the  
      final proximal orbits.   No data is available past 2017-258, as the    
      mission ended by flying the Cassini spacecraft into Saturn.            
                                                                             
  LIMITATIONS                                                                
  ===========                                                                
                                                                             
    During the period from launch through 2004-256, a flight software        
    error caused data corruption when mass scans were accumulated to         
    reduce data rates. These data are identified by a value of the           
    COADD_CNT greater than 1.                                                
                                                                             
    Prior to 2005-058 the flight software velocity compensation              
    algorithm clipped only the lens voltage that reached its limit,          
    allowing the other three voltages to be adjusted. This resulted in       
    the voltages failing to maintain their proper relation- ships. This      
    was corrected by insuring that once one voltage reached its limit,       
    all four voltages were frozen.                                           
                                                                             
   The Earth Received Time (TERTTIME) and the Processed Time (TPROCESSEDTIME)
   are reversed in the HKG data in version 5 files (and earlier versions).   
   This has been corrected in version 6 files.
