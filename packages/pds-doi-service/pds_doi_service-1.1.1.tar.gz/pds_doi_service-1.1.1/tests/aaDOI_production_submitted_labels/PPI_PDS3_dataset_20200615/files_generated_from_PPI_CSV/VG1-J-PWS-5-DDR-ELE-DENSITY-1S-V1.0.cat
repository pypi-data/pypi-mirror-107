    This data set consists of ASCII formatted plasma wave frequency           
    and electron plasma density measurements as measured by the Plasma        
    Waves Science instrument and calculated from the equations of cold        
    plasma theory.  These frequency measurements were taken from              
    Voyager 1 electric field waveform samples from Voyager 1 Plasma           
    Wave Science (PWS) waveform receiver obtained during its Jupiter          
    flyby.  The data set includes select measurements from spacecraft         
    event time (SCET) 1979-03-01T19:58:22.500Z to                             
    1979-03-21T14:25:32.500Z.  The data are separated into day files          
    and the individual data points are taken every 1-second.  As will         
    be explained in more detail below, the frequency measurements and         
    therefore the density measurements in this data set are measured          
    from high-resolution wideband plasma wave spectra.  To learn more         
    about these spectra and their specific submitted volumes, see the         
    Related PDS Products section in the AAREADME files found in the           
    root directory of this volume.

    While the data essential to this volume are the electron plasma           
    densities, there are a number of other plasma parameters included         
    with this data.  The data set consists of ASCII files with one            
    record per time step, occurring in 1-second increments.  Each             
    record includes the time, magnetic field strength (obtained from          
    the Voyager 1 magnetometer), the electron cyclotron frequency (if         
    available), the frequency of the cutoff or resonance measured, a          
    code indicating the name of the frequency measured, the calculated        
    electron density, and a set of position coordinates for the               
    spacecraft at the time of the observation.  Also included in each         
    record are the electron plasma frequency fpe, extraordinary mode          
    cutoff frequency fR=0, ordinary mode cutoff frequency fL=0, upper         
    hybrid resonance frequency fUH, and a quality index.  One of these        
    four frequencies is just a copy of the measured cutoff or resonance       
    frequency while the remaining frequencies are calculated using the        
    magnetic field data and the equations of cold plasma theory.              
    Different files are used for each day.

  ==========                                                                  
    The ASCII density data files produced in this volume were derived         
    from measuring the characteristic frequencies from the local plasma.      
    The density was calculated from these data, along with cyclotron          
    frequency data derived from magnetic field data, using the equations      
    of cold plasma theory.                                                    
                                                                              
    In order to measure these characteristic frequencies, this work           
    utilizes a new program that allows the operator to highlight the          
    general vicinity of the cutoff or resonance on a frequency-time           
    spectrogram.  Then, an algorithm finds the cutoff or resonance in         
    the region and records the frequency at 1 second intervals.  Hence,       
    the automated procedure has a high temporal resolution (1 second)         
    and requires a relatively low level of both manual effort and             
    subjective judgment by the operator.                                      
                                                                              
    There are two different algorithms used: one for cutoff detection         
    and one for resonance or peak detection.  The cutoff detection            
    algorithm is controlled by a small number of parameters that can          
    be set by the operator.  The first parameter is the cutoff level.         
    In determining possible cutoff candidates, the algorithm scans the        
    region highlighted by the operator and records two separate points,       
    one above the cutoff level and one below.  The closer the two points      
    are, temporally, the steeper the slope will be.  Therefore, the           
    operator can change the location of the cutoff level to manipulate        
    where the algorithm looks for cutoffs within the highlighted region       
    of interest.  The next parameter is the slope magnitude, which            
    designates the minimum magnitude of the finite difference slope           
    where the cutoff must reside.  The operator may raise the slope           
    level in order to scan only for sharp cutoffs, or lower it in order       
    to accommodate less steep slopes, depending on the quality of the         
    spectrum data.  When there is more than one possible cutoff, the          
    detection program will display them as cutoff candidates.  The            
    cutoff level, slope magnitude and cutoff candidates are displayed by      
    the program for viewing by the operator.  While the algorithm             
    chooses the lowest frequency cutoff by default, the operator may          
    override the algorithm and choose any of the possible cutoffs to be       
    recorded.                                                                 
                                                                              
    While most of the characteristic frequencies are, by definition,          
    the cutoff of propagating wave modes, there are certain                   
    circumstances when the characteristic frequency is denoted as the         
    peak of a wave mode in the spectrum.  Because of this, there is an        
    algorithm specifically for resonance or peak detection.  Many             
    spectra of interest to this study include Z-mode radiation, which         
    has a low-frequency cutoff at fL=0.  Barbosa et al.                       
    [BARBOSAETAL1990B] demonstrated that taking the peak of the Z-mode        
    as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the determination of            
    fpe.  Hence, when the Z-mode is enhanced, we utilize the peak             
    detection algorithm to identify fL=0 from which fpe and the               
    electron density can be derived.  This algorithm can also be used         
    to determine fUH when an enhancement at that frequency is present         
    in the spectrum.  In order to measure this resonance or spectral          
    peak, the peak detection algorithm fits a Gaussian curve to the           
    highest peak within the region specified by the program operator.         
    The algorithm then records the frequency of the Gaussian's peak           
    as the peak frequency in the spectrum.  The algorithm displays            
    the spectrum and a darker line which is the Gaussian.  Because            
    there may be noise which exhibits a large peak in the highlighted         
    spectrum, the spectrum is displayed along with the Gaussian curve         
    and a vertical line designating where the peak was measured.              
    The operator always has the ability to manually change the peak's         
    location and alter the measurement in such cases.                         
                                                                              
    While the operator utilizes a color spectrogram to guide the cutoff       
    and peak detectors, we emphasize that this is only used as a means        
    of identifying the appropriate range in frequency for the algorithm       
    to search.  The direct use of color spectrograms tends to mislead         
    an operator to perceive a cutoff that is not equivalent to the            
    cutoff in the actual power spectrum [BARBOSAETAL1990B]. Because           
    this may lead to a systematic error in the data, the algorithm            
    utilizes the spectrum itself, and does not depend on a color scale        
    to determine the characteristic frequencies. This should reduce           
    systematic error and lead to more accurate results.                       
                                                                              
  Data Coverage                                                               
  =============                                                               
    This data set does not provide complete coverage of the time              
    intervals when Voyager 1 was within Jupiter's magnetosphere.  Two         
    criteria were necessary in order for density measurements to be           
    obtained.  First, wideband waveform data must exist.  These data are      
    waveforms sampled at 4-bit resolution and have a frequency range          
    from 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are collected for 55.56-msec          
    at a rate of 28,800 samples per second, and are then followed by a        
    4.44-msec gap.  These 60-msec intervals make up one line of               
    waveform samples.  The spectrograms then consist of 48-second             
    'frames', consisting of up to 800 lines or 48 seconds each.  Because      
    these data compete with Voyager imaging data for the downlink             
    resource, data is available only a fraction of the time.  Plasma          
    wave spectra data can be either continuous, periodic (such as one         
    48-second frame out of every four such frames), or simply present         
    sporadically.  Second, spectral features which exhibit a cutoff or        
    resonance related to the electron density must be observable in the       
    spectrum.  By far the most prevalent emission of use is the               
    non-thermal continuum radiation, whose low frequency cutoff is at         
    fpe.  This radiation literally fills the magnetosphere between the        
    magnetopause and higher density regions of the inner magnetosphere.       
    However, some regions include other emissions and regions when the        
    plasma frequency does not have a clear cutoff.  If the plasma             
    frequency is not measured directly from the spectrum for any reason,      
    it may be calculated from the local magnetic field data (essentially      
    fce) and one of three other characteristic frequencies using the          
    equations of cold plasma theory.  Thus, magnetic field data must          
    exist for regions when fpe is not present, or the electron density        
    cannot be calculated.  Typically, continuum radiation is not present      
    inside of approximately 20 to 25 Jovian radii.  There is at least         
    twice as much data derived from Voyager 1 than Voyager 2 and data         
    exists typically from approximately 20 to 65 Jovian radii.                
                                                                              
  Interpretations                                                             
  ===============                                                             
    High resolution wideband waveform data were used to measure               
    characteristic frequencies (peaks and cutoffs) which relate to the        
    electron plasma density.  When dealing with a variety of                  
    spectrograms and plasma conditions found in different regions of          
    the Jovian magnetosphere, it is necessary to interpret the present        
    modes and characteristic frequencies correctly in order to determine      
    the most accurate value for the electron plasma density.  Below, we       
    will briefly discuss the methods used for interpreting different          
    spectra.  A more thorough explanation of the interpretations              
    including examples of different spectra can be found in the               
    DENSITY.DOC and DENSITY.PDF files within the DOCUMENTS directory          
    accessible from the root directory of this volume.                        
                                                                              
    The simplest spectra to interpret for the purposes of determining         
    the electron plasma density are those that include non-thermal            
    continuum radiation with a clear low frequency cutoff and with no         
    other emissions obscuring the cutoff.  For the purposes of this           
    data set, we agree with the Gurnett et al. [1981] interpretation          
    that based upon PWS data it is appropriate to assume that the             
    continuum radiation cutoff is fpe and we can accurately determine         
    the local electron plasma density using the appropriate equation          
    from cold plasma theory.  The electron plasma density is directly         
    proportional to the square of the electron plasma frequency and           
    therefore in this case the determination of the density does not          
    depend on magnetic field measurements.  When there is only one            
    cutoff present in the continuum radiation, we assume that the             
    continuum radiation is propagating in the ordinary mode and that          
    the cutoff is indeed the plasma frequency.  An alternate possibility      
    would be to identify this cutoff as the R=0 cutoff at fR=0.  But,         
    most theories [Shaw and Gurnett, 1980; Moses et. al., 1987;               
    Barbosa et al., 1990] favor the L,O mode as the most likely               
    continuum radiation component, hence, we assume that there is always      
    at least some L,O component present when the continuum radiation is       
    detected.                                                                 
                                                                              
    Sometimes, more than one wave mode cutoff is present at different         
    frequencies for the same time period.  When this is the case, we          
    use a guess-and-check system called Consistency Checks.  The method       
    is as follows:                                                            
                                                                              
    1. Assume that one frequency cutoff/peak present in the spectrum is       
       a particular characteristic frequency.                                 
    2. Use the local magnetic field data (which determines fce) along         
       with the equations from cold plasma theory to calculate the            
       remaining characteristic frequencies.                                  
    3. Look for consistency between the calculated frequencies and the        
       remaining spectral features (cutoffs/peaks) present.                   
                                                                              
    A consistent interpretation is one where the calculated frequencies       
    match the cutoffs/peaks present in the spectrum.  In some examples        
    there exist two spectral cutoffs which need identification in order       
    to calculate the electron plasma density.  By using a Consistency         
    Check, (mainly, assuming fpe is the lower cutoff and calculating the      
    remaining characteristic frequencies) it is found that when the           
    plasma frequency is assumed to be the lower frequency cutoff, the         
    cutoff at higher frequencies matches the calculated R=0 frequency.        
                                                                              
    In addition to the non-thermal continuum radiation with a low             
    frequency cutoff at fpe, another mode of propagating waves (called        
    Z-mode) is sometimes also present.  Based upon results from our           
    consistency checks and in agreement with the previous work of             
    Barbosa et. al. [1990], we conclude that there are two types of           
    Z-mode radiation: weak, broadband Z-mode and intense, narrowband          
    Z-mode. We interpret the L=0 frequency as the cutoff of the weak,         
    broadband radiation, however, when the Z-mode emission becomes            
    intense we have found that taking the L=0 frequency as the peak of        
    the intense emission gives the most consistent estimate for fpe.          
    This is because as the intensity of this peak increases, the width        
    of the emission appears to broaden due to limitations in the Fourier      
    transform and the low dynamic range of the 4-bit waveform system on       
    Voyager 1.  Barbosa et al. [1990] demonstrated that taking the peak       
    of the Z-mode as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the               
    determination of fpe, which concurs with our consistency checks.          
    Thus, in regions where Z-mode is present, we can determine the            
    electron density by either measuring the cutoff of the broadband          
    Z-mode as fL=0 or the peak of the narrowband intense Z-mode as fL=0,      
    and using the equations of cold plasma theory.                            
                                                                              
    As Voyager approaches the lobe of the magnetosphere, the density as       
    well as fpe drops precipitously and approaches or even drops below        
    the cyclotron frequency.  Perraut et al. [PERRAUTETAL1998] studied        
    one such case obtained by the Galileo plasma wave instrument.  In         
    order to determine the proper identification of the characteristic        
    frequencies and determine the electron plasma density, we utilize         
    our previous consistency check method.  When an interpretation is         
    found to be consistent with the spectrum, we assume temporal              
    continuity of the cutoffs, and extend the interpretation into             
    regions where a consistency check is not possible due to lack of          
    features in the spectrum or a lack of magnetic field data.  While         
    there is no method for determining the density certainly in these         
    regions, we believe that assuming that the spectrum does not change       
    greatly in a span on the order of minutes is appropriate and              
    suitable to determine the density.  A more thorough look into time        
    periods where fpe &#10094;&#10094; fce, including multiple examples, is included

    Included in this data set are two coordinate systems that ensure an       
    accurate location of the density data points.  The first system of        
    coordinates consists of distance, longitude and magnetic latitude         
    and is referred to commonly as the Jovigraphic coordinate system,         
    or one that is fixed to the rotation of the planet. We have used the      
    System III Jovigraphic coordinate system which uses the planet's          
    magnetic field to measure the rotation. The radial distance is            
    defined as the distance from the center of Jupiter to the spacecraft      
    (in kilometers) divided by the radius of Jupiter at the equator           
    (71492km).  In the usual astronomical convention, the longitude is        
    a west longitude which increases with time from an observer above         
    the system, rather than just the angle of rotation about the z-axis.      
                                                                              
    The other coordinate system included is referred to as the                
    Jovicentric Solar Ecliptic (JSE) system. This coordinate system has       
    its x-axis point from Jupiter toward the Sun, and its y-axis is           
    chosen to be in the ecliptic plane pointing toward dusk (thus             
    opposing planetary motion). Its z-axis is parallel to the ecliptic        
    pole. All X, Y, and Z coordinates are measured in Jovian radii (1         
    Rj = 71492km).

  Confidence Level Overview                                                   
  =========================                                                   
    In order to determine the density, we used an analysis tool that          
    measured characteristic frequencies from PWS wideband spectrograms.       
    This frequency detection tool contained both a cutoff and peak            
    algorithm which measured either the cutoff of the spectrum or the         
    peak, respectively.  Two different semi-interchangeable systems of        
    confidence analysis were used depending on which algorithm was used.      
                                                                              
    In order to record the confidence of the cutoff frequency                 
    measurements, data quality indices were given to each data point.         
    The indices range from 0 to 3 with 0 being a cutoff with the highest      
    confidence and 3 being the least. The amount of noise in the              
    spectrum dictates the quality rating given to a particular data           
    point.  Points with a minimal amount of noise are given values of 0,      
    whereas points where the spectral noise is so great that the cutoff       
    is unclear are given a 1 or 2 index depending on the severity of the      
    noise.  A data quality index of 3 is given when there are                 
    obstructions in the spectrum blocking the ability for an accurate         
    measurement, or when there is such a significant amount of                
    background spectral noise that the spectra must be time-averaged          
    over a longer period of time in order to interpret the cutoff.  For       
    example, the Voyager wideband receivers have notch filters that are       
    used to suppress interference at the power supply frequency of            
    2.4 kHz and its third harmonic.  When a cutoff resides near a notch       
    filter, a data quality index of 3 is used.  While the notch filters       
    do not span more than 200 Hz, any measurement made near them is           
    considered uncertain.                                                     
                                                                              
    In order to determine an estimate of the error of a peak                  
    measurement, the full-width at half maximum of the Gaussian curve         
    is measured and recorded along with its peak frequency.  The              
    narrower the peak is, the more accurate the measurement will be.          
    This quantitative method is superior to the quality data indices          
    described above.  However, to provide a consistent data set we have       
    also translated the width of the peak to quality indices by               
    assigning an index of 0 for 0 &#10094; deltaf &#10094;= 20 Hz, 1 for                    
    20 &#10094; deltaf &#10094;= 35 Hz, 2 for 35 &#10094; deltaf &#10094;= 50 Hz, and 3 for               
    deltaf &#10095; 50 Hz.                                                           
                                                                              
  Limitations                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
    Since the Fourier transform parameters used to produce the spectra        
    yield a spectral resolution of 28 Hz, this represents the ultimate        
    accuracy with which a cutoff can be determined.  Previously, we           
    discussed the Consistency Check method when two or more                   
    characteristic frequencies were identified consistently with the          
    spectrum and used to determine fpe, whether the plasma frequency is       
    visible or not.  For all the density data compiled using this             
    process with Voyager 1 and 2, the calculated frequencies typically        
    agree with the features observed in the spectrum to several 10's of       
    Hz.  Almost all cases agree to within 100 Hz.                             
                                                                              
    The uncertainty in fpe translates into a variable uncertainty in the      
    plasma density and is greater in a relative sense when the plasma         
    frequency is low.  For example, if we assume an error of 100 Hz in        
    any measurement, a measurement at 300 Hz produces a 70% fractional        
    uncertainty in the density.  However, if the measurement is made at       
    3 kHz, then the fractional uncertainty of the density is much             
    smaller, approximately 7%.                                                
                                                                              
    It is important to note that if the plasma frequency is not present       
    in the spectrum, the electron plasma density must be calculated           
    using another characteristic frequency and the cyclotron frequency,       
    which is directly proportional to the local magnetic field.  If           
    magnetic field data do not exist for a region where the plasma            
    frequency cannot be measured, the density can not be determined.          
                                                                              
    There are a small number of regions containing anomalous magnetic         
    field data which may affect the density calculation.  These magnetic      
    field dropouts are sharp, momentary decreases or increases in the         
    magnetic field which are instrumental effects and do not represent        
    realistic occurrences.  They are characterized by a magnetic              
    fluctuation of several orders of magnitude in a span of less than         
    one minute.  Regions of anomalous magnetic field data which               
    affected density measurements were changed manually from their            
    anomalous values to the floater value -1 and the subsequent               
    freqeuency and density calculations were changed appropriately.           
                                                                              
    During any given time step in Voyager spectrogram data, there may         
    be more than one measurable frequency which can be used to calculate      
    the density.  To obtain the final data set included in this volume,       
    a number of steps were followed to take many measured frequencies         
    and conclude with only one density measurement for each time step.        
    Firstly, each frequency cutoff and/or peak that could be measured         
    from Voyager spectrogram data was measured separately and saved in        
    individual folders designating the frequency which had been measured      
    (e.j. p_files, l_files, r_files, u_files).  The digitized frequency       
    data files contain only a time stamp, a frequency measurement, and        
    either a data quality index or a full-width at half-maximum value.        
    Next, this data were run through a program which creates new files        
    (1 for each measured frequency) with the same structure as in the         
    final data of this volume.  This includes compiling magnetic field        
    data and coordinate data for each time step, and calculating the          
    characteristic frequencies and density based upon the appropriate         
    measured frequency.  This output a maximum of four separate versions      
    (based upon how many frequencies were measured) of the final data         
    for each particular time step.                                            
    It is necessary to use only one interpretation (one measured              
    frequency) of the spectra for a particular time step in order to          
    obtain only one calculation of the density for that time step.            
    Therefore, an 'index' file is created which specifies the correct         
    interpretations to be used for every Voyager 1 and 2 time period.         
    Then, a program was run which read the index file, selected the           
    correct time record (from either p, L, R, or u files), and copied         
    the record into the final data day-files.                                 
    The final day-files were then checked for measurement errors or           
    anomalous magnetic field data which caused incorrect density              
    calculations.  Data points found were either deleted or the fce           
    values, based directly upon magnetic field measurements, were             
    switched from their anomalous value to -1 floater values.  For a          
    complete list of manually altered data values, see POSTPROD_V1.TXT        
    and POSTPROD_V2.TXT which are located in the EXTRAS directory             
    accessible from the root directory of this volume.  The final step        
    converted the files into .CSV files which are the final data found        
    in this volume.                                                           
                                                                              
    The present investigation focuses only on the outer magnetosphere.        
    However, the work of Scarf et al. in 1979 [SCARFETAL1979] has             
    shown that in the inner magnetosphere, other wave                         
    phenomena such as the upper hybrid resonance band can be used to          
    infer the plasma density.  For future investigations, our                 
    resonance/peak algorithm may be used to accurately determine the          
    plasma density in regions inside ~20 Jovian radii. "
