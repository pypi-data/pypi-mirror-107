    Lunar Prospector magnetometer (MAG) Level 3 Data (CODMAC Level 5).        
    Regional Field Bins at the S/C Altitude.  Interpolation                   
    and two-dimensional filtering are applied to the Level 2 data to          
    produce gridded field component data files on a surface defined by        
    the slowly varying S/C altitude.  The spatial resolution of the           
    grid is chosen to be much less than the mean S/C altitude.

  Parameters:                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    The measured parameters consist of the three vector components            
    of the lunar crustal magnetic field in East, North, and Radial            
    (ENR) coordinates, the field magnitude, and the spacecraft                
    altitude.  The units of the field measurements are nanoTeslas (nT).       
    1 nT = 0.00001 Gauss.  The units of the spacecraft altitude are           
    kilometers (km).  ENR coordinates are centered at the instantaneous       
    spacecraft location with X directed eastward, Y directed northward,       
    and Z directed radial to the Moon.                                        
                                                                              
                                                                              
  ====================================================================        
  Processing:                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    Step 1:  A two-dimensional filtering algorithm is applied to              
    final selected LP magnetometer Level 2 orbit segments to produce          
    a gridded file suitable for mapping.  The program first sorts the         
    data into latitude / longitude bins and averages values within            
    a single bin (e.g., 0.5 by 0.5 degrees for data acquired at               
    altitudes near 100 km).  A moving boxcar method is                        
    then applied to two-dimensionally filter the mean gridded                 
    measurements.  A 5 bin by 5 bin filter size is                            
    normally chosen.  This step is repeated twice, separately for             
    each field component and the S/C altitude.  Finally, the                  
    resulting field magnitude is calculated from the smoothed                 
    component files on the same two-dimensional grid.                         
    The resulting two-dimensionally filtered gridded files are                
    the Level 3 data.  They contain latitude, longitude, the                  
    field component in nT (or the altitude in km), and the number             
    of data points in each bin.                                               
                                                                              
    Step 2:  If a significant longitudinal gap between                        
    usable orbit segments is present, linear interpolation between the        
    two nearest orbit segments is applied to create an interpolated           
    orbit segment.  This interpolated segment is then read into the           
    two-dimensional filtering code to fill in the missing grid values.        
    This method is applied only when the gap between usable orbits is         
    smaller than the 5-bin size of the two-dimensional filter.                
                                                                              
    Step 3:  For visualization purposes, a suitable                           
    graphics utility is applied to construct regional shaded contour          
    plots of the vector components of the crustal field, the field            
    magnitude, and the mean S/C altitude.  These are contained in a           
    postscript file that is included with the filtered gridded files.         
    The file naming convention for the postscript files is the same           
    as for data files (see below), but with a .PS extension.

    The two-dimensionally filtered gridded files are named as follows:

            xxx is either RAD, EAS, NOR, TOT or ALT, indicating

                east B component, north B component, total B, or

      where ddd indicates a day (and thus ddd - ddd is a range of days),      
            p and xxx are as for 1998 data.                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Each file (in ascii format) contains the latitude, east longitude,        
    the field component (or total field, or altitude) at the grid             
    point, and the number of data points in the bin centered at the           
    grid point. The altitude is estimated by subtracting the mean lunar       
    radius (1738 km) from the radial distance of the spacecraft to the        
    lunar center of figure.                                                   
                                                                              
    The columns in each data file are as follows:                             
                                                                              
      Column 1: Latitude at this grid point (South is negative;               
          North is positive).                                                 
      Column 2: East longitude at this grid point.                            
      Column 3: Magnetic field value in nanoTeslas or altitude in             
          kilometers.  The last part of the file name before the dot          
          indicates what is contained in this column (EAS = East field        
          component; NOR = North field component; RAD = Radial field          
          component; TOT = total field; ALT = Altitude).                      
      Column 4: Number of data points in this latitude/longitude bin.         
          The bin size can be deduced from the difference between             
          successive latitude and longitude values (e.g., 0.5 degrees         
          by 0.5 degrees for altitudes near 100 km; 0.25 degrees by           
          0.25 degrees for altitudes near 25 km)."

    2003-10-01 are being prepared for peer review by the PDS.

  ============                                                                
                                                                              
    The quality of the measurements is a                                      
    strong function of the spacecraft altitude, which varies from a           
    minimum of about 80 km during the first year of the mission to a          
    minimum of about 15 km during the final six months of the                 
    mission.  The best crustal field measurements were therefore              
    obtained during the final ''extended mission'' phase when the             
    orbit periapsis was lowest.  The surface resolution of the                
    measurements is normally of the same order as the spacecraft              
    altitude.  However, at the lowest altitudes (about 15 km), the            
    resolution is limited also by the orbit track separation, which           
    is approximately 30 km at the lunar equator.  The accuracy to             
    which the crustal field is measured at a single point along the           
    spacecraft trajectory is limited by residual external field               
    variations and is approximately 0.1 nT.

    The coverage of the measurements over the lunar surface is limited        
    to those areas on the near and far side when the Moon and the LP          
    spacecraft were favorably located to allow direct measurements of         
    the crustal magnetic field."
