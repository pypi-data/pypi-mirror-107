      1. The Anisotropy Telescopes                                            
      ----------------------------                                            
      The Anisotropy Telescope (AT) experiment is a two-telescope             
      device. The telescopes are nominally identical with Telescope           
      T1 pointing at 60 degrees to the spacecraft spin axis (i.e. in          
      the Earthward looking hemisphere) and telescope T2 pointing at          
      145 degrees (i.e. in the anti-Earthward looking hemisphere).            
      They have a full-cone opening aperture of 70 degrees and a              
      geometric factor of 0.7 cm^2 sr. Together they provide 80%              
      coverage of the full sky. The most significant gap in the               
      coverage is a cone with a half angle of 25 degrees centered on          
      the Earthward pointing line along the spacecraft spin-axis.             
      There is also a 5 degree gap in coverage between the two                
      telescopes.

      Spin-averaged and sectored data in a variety of energy channels         
      is produced by the ATs, as follows:

      3. AT data provided to the Ulysses Data System                          
      ----------------------------------------------                          
      The AT data provided in these files is a subset of the total            
      data set which is held at Imperial College.                             
                                                                              
      The format of these files is as follows:                                
      There is one data file per day. Each data file contains data            
      records for every ten minute interval in the day, except                
      during the Jupiter encounter (1992, days 25 to 48 inclusive)            
      where data at 256s resolution is provided.                              
                                                                              
      Each record contains 17 fields of information, the first                
      being a time-stamp referring to the centre time of the data             
      contained in the remaining 16 fields. The definition of these           
      fields, including their FORTRAN format, is given below.                 
                                                                              
      N.B. Fluxes quoted are from telescope T1, which points at 60            
      degrees to the spacecraft spin axis.

      3.1 Definition of flux                                                  
      ----------------------                                                  
      in this table, flux means differential flux in units of                 
      (cm^2 sr s MeV)^-1 (NB. per MeV, not per MeV per nucleon).              
      The fluxes have been computed by dividing the observed count            
      rates by the geometric factor and the energy channel width.             
      The energy channel width depends on species. Where a channel            
      is sensitive to alpha particles and protons (i.e., channels             
      1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9), the proton width has been used since           
      normally the alpha contribution is insignificant. However,              
      sufficient information has been given above to reconstruct the          
      channel count-rates if necessary.                                       
                                                                              
      All AT channels exhibit a 'background' which may originate from         
      electronic noise or from activation of the material of the              
      telescopes or of the spacecraft. These background fluxes have           
      been subtracted from the data provided in these files. Channel          
      3 and channel 7 are the channels least affected by background           
      and it is for this reason that channel 7 has been selected to           
      provide the sectored data included in these files.                      
                                                                              
      The data have also been 'despiked', although it is not                  
      guaranteed that all spikes have been removed.                           
                                                                              
                                                                              
      3.2 Definition of sectors                                               
      -------------------------                                               
      All sectored channels except channel 13 have eight 45 degree            
      sectors. Channel 13 has only 4 sectors. Sector 1 of channel             
      13 is a 90 degree sector equivalent to sectors 1 & 2 of any of          
      the other sectored channels. Similarly, sector 2 of channel             
      13 is equivalent to sectors 3 & 4 of any other sectored                 
      channel, etc.                                                           
                                                                              
      The sectoring scheme is defined relative to the 'sun crossing           
      line'. The sun-crossing line is the line in the plane defined           
      by the Sun, the Earth and Ulysses, which is perpendicular to            
      the Ulysses-Earth line and which makes an angle of less than            
      90 degrees to the Ulysses-Sun line. For channels with 8                 
      sectors, sector 1 is the 45 degree sector which starts from             
      the sun-crossing line and extends in the sense of spacecraft            
      rotation. Sector 2 begins at the angle that sector 1 ends and           
      continues in the sense of spacecraft rotation, etc, continuing          
      through to sector 8 which ends at the the sun-crossing line."
