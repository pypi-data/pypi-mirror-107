This dataset contains vectors collected by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter         
(previously Pioneer 12) Magnetometer which have been averaged over           
24 seconds on 12 second centers. The data are provided in spacecraft

the booms was causing a problem, the spin axis was moved to the              
pole of the Venus orbital plane.                                             
  The X-axis of the spacecraft coordinate system is toward the sun           
along the projection of the Venus Sun line on the spacecraft                 
equatorial (X-Y) plane.  The Y axis is chosen to form a right handed         
orthogonal triad if the axis are selected in alphabetical order.             
Hence, the Y direction points roughly opposite to the direction of           
Venus motion about the sun. Software is provided which allows users          
to convert the magnetic field data from S/C coordinates to geophysical       
coordinates. The magnetic field file contains the following information:

These data have been reprocessed several times during the course             
of the mission. Each successive reprocessing has eliminated some             
of the problems found in earlier version of the data.  Please bring          
to the attention of the original investigator any suspicious section         
of data. No zero level correction has been applied to the data because
