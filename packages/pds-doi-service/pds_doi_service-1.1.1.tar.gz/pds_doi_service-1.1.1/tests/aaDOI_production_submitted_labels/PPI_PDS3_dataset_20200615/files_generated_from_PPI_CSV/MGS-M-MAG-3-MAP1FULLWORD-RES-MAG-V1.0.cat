  Overview:

    This data set contains vector magnetic field data acquired by             
    the Fluxgate section of the Magnetometer / Electron                       
    Reflectometer instrument aboard the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS)            
    spacecraft. The data are provided at a variable time resolution           
    depending on the telemetry rate available to the investigation            
    for the time period beginning with the prime mission mapping              
    (1999-03-08). The data in the dataset cover the entire                    
    mapping time period.                                                      
                                                                              
    The data are calibrated and provided in physical units (nT). In           
    addition, instrumental and spacecraft effects have been removed           
    from the data during processing. The data are provided in                 
    several geophysical coordinate systems in order to make them              
    directly usable for many analysis problems.                               
                                                                              
    The magnetometers on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) are not boom              
    mounted. They are mounted at the outer edge of the two solar              
    panels, and both are about the same distance from the center of           
    the spacecraft. In the traditional dual magnetometer technique,           
    one of the two magnetometers is mounted at the end of a boom              
    (outboard mag) and the other mounted closer to the spacecraft             
    body (inboard mag). The data acquisition scheme usually allows            
    for more rapid sampling of one or the other magnetometer to               
    optimize the telemetry allocation usage. The outboard mag is              
    usually describes as the the primary mag, the inboard as the              
    secondary. On the Mars Observer mission, the magnetometer                 
    sensors were boom-mounted; Mars Global Surveyor uses flight               
    spares mounted at the edge of the solar panels, approximately             
    5.2 meters away from the spacecraft center. MGS data processing           
    software is based upon software developed for Mars Observer.              
                                                                              
    For MGS, we will preserve the terminology outboard and inboard            
    mag for simplicity but we must define which is which.                     
                                                                              
    By definition, the MGS OUTBOARD MAG is on the S/C +Y solar panel          
                   the MGS INBOARD  MAG is on the S/C -Y solar panel          
                                                                              
    The bulk of the telemetry allocation is utilized by the outboard          
    magnetometer.

  Sampling:                                                                   
  =========                                                                   
                                                                              
    The instrument samples the magnetic field at a rate of 32                 
    samples per second by using a clock system derived from the               
    spacecraft system real-time interrupt (RTI) clock. Raw samples            
    are averaged in the instrument according to the telemetry mode            
    for the spacecraft and the data allocation for the MAG/ER                 
    investigation. The MAG investigation utilizes a data compression          
    scheme to make efficient use of spacecraft telemetry while at             
    the same time preserving the ability to recover gracefully from           
    spacecraft telemetry errors and the like. A primary MAG full              
    word sample consists of a 12 bit value for the x component, a 12          
    bit sample for the y component, a 12 bit sample for the z                 
    component (all in sensor coordinates) and a 4 bit range word              
    (bit one is an autorange/manual range switch; bits 2,3,4 are the          
    0-7 range designation). Each primary MAG full word sample is              
    followed by 23 difference samples in which the 6 bit difference           
    from the previous value is telemetered, effectively doubling the          
    data rate obtained within the telemetry allocation.                       
    Reconstructed full words are generated in ground data processing          
    for high rate (detail) data. This archive consists of outboard            
    full word samples, which occur every 0.75s, 1.5s, or 3.0s,                
    depending on the telemetry allocation.                                    
                                                                              
    Onboard averages are non-overlapping boxcar averages. Time tags           
    are placed at the center of the averaging interval. The data              
    rate allocation is summarized in the following table:

    Actual ranges may be expected to deviate from the nominal                 
    (design) range by varying amounts, ranging from as much as 5%.            
                                                                              
    The instrument noise level is 0.006 nT rms over a                         
    10 Hz bandwidth. Note that in-flight performance is limited               
    by the level of magnetic noise generated by the MGS spacecraft            
    and the instruments it carries. Magnetic field fluctuations are           
    best studied in either the sensor coordinate system (fixed to             
    and aligned with the spacecraft solar panels) or the spacecraft           
    payload coordinate system, since large differences in rms                 
    fluctuations can be seen in these components. The sensor y                
    component evidences shows the smallest rms fluctuations of                
    approximately 0.05 nT, whereas the x and z components are more

  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    Raw data are processed by applying a series of corrections                
    which include sensor zero levels offsets, gain factors,                   
    scaling to physical units, and subsequent rotation into                   
    payload and geophysical coordinates.                                      
                                                                              
    Instrument calibration is routinely monitored inflight.                   
    The instrument zero levels and gains are quite stable over large          
    temperature ranges and time periods. Of more concern                      
    is the magnetic field generated by the spacecraft itself. In              
    flight tests suggest that variation of the spacecraft field               
    observed at the position of the magnetometer sensors when they            
    are articulated in the frame of reference of the spacecraft               
    is about 5 nT (static field). It is believed that this field is           
    largely due to the TWTA amplifiers mounted on the communications          
    dish (which was not deployed until after mapping orbit began).            
                                                                              
    For Science Phasing orbits (SPO), the solar panels did not                
    articulate and compensation for spacecraft fields can be done by          
    simple adjustment to the instrument zero table; this method was           
    used in the production of SPO datasets. Note that this method             
    only works for SPO mission phase, and requires a stationary               
    high gain antenna as well.                                                
                                                                              
    NOTE that special spacecraft maneuvers were needed before an              
    adequate spacecraft magnetic field model could be developed. These        
    maneuvers were executed in late 1999 and February, 2000 (HGA              
    articulation sequences). The February 2000 maneuvers resulted in          
    a model for the field of the HGA. The dynamic fields are still under      
    study but a preliminary model is provided and used in the                 
    reduction of this dataset (July, 2000).

  Spacecraft Field Estimation and Compensation:                               
  ============================================                                
                                                                              
    The spacecraft field estimation and compensation is a bit involved.       
    The magnetometer measures the field due to all sources, the ambient       
    field plus that of the spacecraft. The spacecraft may generate            
    magnetic fields in many ways; the estimation problem is largely one       
    of identifying correctly what on the spacecraft is responsible for        
    the interference. It is usually very helpful to have specialized          
    tests pre-launch to identify the prominent sources. Often one finds       
    that it is impractical to operate the spacecraft in precisely the         
    manner it will in space (e.g., powered by solar panels, power             
    subsystem state, component articulations, thermal environment, and        
    so on). Pre-launch tests of the MGS spacecraft identified permanent       
    magnets on the High Gain Antenna (HGA) as the most significant            
    source and sources associated with the power subsystem primary            
    harness which were partially corrected.                                   
                                                                              
    We categorize spacecraft sources as static or dynamic. Static             
    fields are due to permanent magnetization, for example, magnets or        
    magnetized objects. Magnetic fields are also produced by current          
    loops, for example in power subsystems, solar arrays, batteries, and      
    so on; these often scale with a known current and are called dynamic      
    fields. For MGS, during mapping operations, the HGA is articulated        
    in the frame of reference of the spacecraft (spacecraft payload           
    coordinates, PL for short) as are the two solar panels upon which         
    the magnetometer sensors are located. Each sensor also has an             
    associated zero offset (for each range) vector which must also be         
    estimated. Note that a spacecraft generated static magnetic field         
    that is in the same reference coordinates as the sensor (sensor           
    coordinates) will behave as a sensor offset.                              
                                                                              
    Spacecraft maneuvers conducted in February, 2000 were very helpful        
    in characterizing the static field associated with the HGA. Of            
    course, since the HGA is constantly articulating, the ''static''          
    field of the HGA is time variable as seen by the sensors. These           
    maneuvers were designed to map the magnetic field of the HGA: the         
    sensors (and solar panels) were set at fixed locations and the HGA        
    was rotated in elevation several times. The field of the HGA could        
    then be determined from the difference between the vector field at        
    the two sensor locations. The difference must be used to eliminate        
    the time variable, and mostly much larger, ambient field.                 
                                                                              
    A more complete model of the field at each sensor takes into account      
    the possibility of a static field associated with the spacecraft          
    and fixed in spacecraft pl coordinates (Bc), as well as dynamic           
    fields both fixed in sensor coordinates (Bod) and fixed in                
    spacecraft payload coordinates (Bcd). The former might arise              
    from imperfect cancellation of current loops on the solar panels          
    and the latter might arise from loops associated with power circuits      
    fixed to the spacecraft body.                                             
                                                                              
    These sources are to be characterized in flight and on orbit about        
    Mars. The ambient field is large (to 250 nT) and variable, all of         
    which looks like very large amplitude ''common mode'' noise to our        
    sensors (in this effort; the ambient field is of course most welcome      
    otherwise). So we can only use the difference between the                 
    measurements to characterize the spacecraft field.                        
                                                                              
    The magnetic field is modeled in sc payload coordinates

             [T] is the transformation from sensor to s/c payload

             Bo  is the sensor zero offsets, constant (static)                
                                                                              
             Ba  is the ambient field in sc payload coordinates               
                                                                              
             Bc  is the spacecraft (body) field (static) in payload           
                 coordinates                                                  
                                                                              
             Bod is field in sensor coordinates that scales with              
                 the power system current (cartesian coordinates)             
                                                                              
             Bcd is the spacecraft (body) field (dynamic) in payload          
                 coordinates that scales with power system current            
                                                                              
             Bod and Bcd are DYNAMIC spacecraft fields                        
                 we ASSUME they both scale with a spacecraft current          
                 as follows:                                                  
                                                                              
             inboard  mag dynamic field scales with solar array               
                 -y panel current;                                            
             outboard mag dynamic field scales with solar array               
                 +y panel current;                                            
                                                                              
             Bcd, the spacecraft body field, scales with total current        
                 (sao_i) output from the (shunted) arrays. This is the        
                 current that goes into the power subsystem on the s/c        
                                                                              
     we use the observation   Bpl (inboard) - Bpl (outboard)                  
     to remove the ambient field. Pure sensor rotations will                  
     constrain Bo, and coupled displacements/rotations (from                  
     solar panel movements) or HGA articulations will be used                 
     to constrain the spacecraft field Bs, modeled as an                      
     offset dipole about the HGA origin.                                      
                                                                              
     A generalized inverse procedure is used to estimate the parameters       
     of the various sources, e.g., the dipole coefficients of the HGA         
     and the offset of the HGA source from the defined center of the          
     HGA coordinate system; or scale factors (nT/A) for the x,y,z             
     components of the dynamic field associated with solar panel              
     current.                                                                 
                                                                              
     The current spacecraft magnetic field model (that used in the            
     processing of this data) is described in sc_mod.ker, provided            
     with this data release. It uses an offset dipole for the HGA             
     (tests demonstrated that no improvement in the fit resulted from         
     using a higher degree and order spherical harmonic), referenced          
     to the HGA coordinate system (which is at the end of the HGA             
     boom, see SPICE documentation). We found that no additional static       
     spacecraft field was needed and so this is zero in the current           
     release. The dynamic fields are at present imperfectly estimated         
     but amount to about 0.2 nT/A or less in each sensor.                     
                                                                              
     This dataset includes additional variables, largely to let the           
     user know exactly what spacecraft fields have been removed from          
     the observations. In the command line variable in the attached           
     header for these files:

     you find an option ''-sc'', this means that the spacecraft field         
     estimated using the model described in the ''sc_mod.ker'' file           
     has been removed from the vector field. In addition to                   
     the variables ob_b (vector ambient magnetic field, ob mag) and           
     posn (spacecraft position) we have added ob_rms (root mean square        
     of the difference words) and ob_bscpl (vector static spacecraft          
     field in pl coordinates) and ob_bdpl (vector dynamic spacecraft          
     field in pl coordinates) and three current measurements from the         
     spacecraft engineering data base sam_i, sap_i, sao_i, for the            
     -y solar array, +y solar array, and total (shunted) solar output         
     all in milliamperes.

  =============                                                               
                                                                              
    The data are provided as ASCII tables of time series data. 
    These files are referred to as standard time series 
    files (STS files), and all such files have a .STS suffix.          
    Each file has an attached header (called an ODL header, which             
    represents the data producer's object definition language,                
    distinct from the PDS Object Description Language). The header            
    contains text describing the file processing and structure.               
                                                                              
    The attached (machine readable) header provides sufficient                
    information to understand what is in the file. A sample                   
    header is given below; it consists of nested OBJECT = KEYWORD             
    and END_OBJECT pairs. This attached header is documentation,              
    applied to the output file by the analysis program. Any                   
    detached header you see with these data has not been generated            
    by the investigator team, but has been added by the PDS for               
    compatibility purposes.                                                   
                                                                              
    The header, as well as any other non-numeric ASCII,                       
    can easily be stripped with the following AWK script:

     print $0                                                                 
     }                                                                        
                                                                              
    The attached header provides a level of traceability for the data         
    product. All of the SPK and CK kernels loaded by the processing           
    program, and used by the processing program to compute spacecraft         
    position and attitude, can be readily identified in the                   
    CK_DOCUMENTATION and SPK_DOCUMENTATION objects. There are several         
    of each that need be consulted to perform the necessary                   
    transformations. Please refer to JPL NAIF documentation for               
    information regarding the SPK and CK kernels.                             
                                                                              
    The user may use either the attached or detached headers for              
    automated plotting, depending on the software you have.                   
    PDS-provided software (if any) uses the detached headers (PDS             
    label files). The OBJECT = RECORD / END_OBJECT nest describes the         
    data in each record, but you must also be cognizant of the CMD_LINE       
    keyword to interpret the vector variables. For example, the               
    lines below indicate that

    the variable ob_b (also known as outboard_b_J2000) is a                   
    real vector variable, consists of scalar components x, and                
    so on, in units nanoteslas. Note that the instrument range                
    is carried as a fourth component of the magnetic field vector, as         
    this practice preserves reversibility. Range values R&#10095;7 indicate          
    automatic range selection on board, with the range = R-8. The             
    range is coded as a four bit binary, with the most significant            
    bit (8) turned on in auto range mode.                                     
                                                                              
    The CMD_LINE options -odl -magonly -pc                                    
    specify that odl header is requested; mag data only is                    
    processed, and magnetic field and position vectors are                    
    TRANSFORMED INTO PC COORDINATES. This is why you need be                  
    cognizant of the CMD_LINE when you interpret the record. The              
    very same data, transformed into sun-state coordinates, will              
    have an identical header but for the CMD_LINE, with -ss                   
    substituted for -pc to indicate that magnetic field and position          
    vectors have been transformed into the sun-state coordinate               
    system. In the CMD_LINE, the option -Mars is implied, unless              
    another body is specified, denoting that the center of Mars is            
    the center of the coordinate system. If instead the option                
    -phobos or -deimos appeared on the command line, the coordinate           
    system is relative to these bodies instead.                               
                                                                              
    (In the following sample attached header, double quotation                
    marks have been replaced by pairs of single quotation marks               
    for the sake of PDS compatibility. A real attached header                 
    can contain double quotation marks.  Also, a few lines have               
    been slightly condensed to reduce line length for ease of                 
    display in the present file.)
