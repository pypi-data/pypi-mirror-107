    This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data from     
    the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the entire           
    mission.  Data after 2019-01-02 will be added to the archive on          
    subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum analyzer      
    observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between,      
    and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases as well as those       
    obtained during the two encounter phases.                                
                                                                             
    The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 75 AU over the     
    course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when some key      
    events occurred during the mission, the following table is provided.

  Data Sampling                                                              
  =============                                                              
    This data set consists of average and peak wave electric field           
    intensities accumulated over 1-hour intervals from the Voyager 2         
    Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained during the entire        
    mission.  For each 1-hour time interval squares of the calibrated        
    electric field measurements obtained during each hour-long interval      
    in each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels are summed and then         
    divided by the number of measurements.  The square root of the           
    resulting value is obtained and stored as the average electric field     
    strength for the respective channel.  During the same hour-long          
    interval, the maximum electric field strength acquired in each of        
    the 16 channels is also recorded and stored as the peak electric         
    field strength for the respective channel.  Hence, for each hour, an     
    average and peak electric field spectrum from 10 Hz to 56.2 kHz is       
    obtained.  The 16 spectrum analyzer channels have center frequencies     
    that range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and are logarithmically       
    spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated      
    with each peak and average spectrum is the time of the beginning of      
    the averaging interval.  Given variations in the sweep rate of the       
    instrument (from a minimum of 4 seconds/sweep to a maximum of 96         
    seconds/sweep) the maximum number of samples in an hour-long             
    interval can range from 900 to 38.  Data gaps within the interval        
    can further reduce the number of samples.                                
                                                                             
    During data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries          
    exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged       
    in any other way.                                                        
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data Processing                                                            
  ===============                                                            
    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are              
    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as      
    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one           
    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds in      
    the full-resolution data set, depending on telemetry mode.) This         
    data set includes one-hour average and peak values for each channel.     
    The data are typically plotted as amplitude vs. time for one or more     
    of the channels in a strip-chart like display, or can be displayed       
    as a frequency-time spectrogram using a gray- or color-bar to            
    indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen channels, it is usually best      
    to stretch the frequency axis by interpolating from one frequency        
    channel to the next either linearly or with a spline fit.  One must      
    be aware if the frequency axis is stretched that more resolution may     
    be implied than is really present.                                       
                                                                             
    The measurements provided in the average and peak electric field         
    spectra included in this data set are in units of electric field         
    (volts/meter).                                                           
                                                                             
    Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of the     
    electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the           
    corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.

    Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral density     
    by the impedance of free space in ohms:

    A failure in the Voyager 2 Flight Data System which occurred about 3     
    months after launch has adversely affected the calibration of PWS        
    channels 9 through 16.  Details of this algorithm may be found           
    in the associated full-resolution description file FULL1_DS.CAT.         
    All suggested data correction steps outlined in the Data Processing      
    section of that file have been applied to the input values prior         
    to calculating the averages and peaks for this reducted resolution       
    dataset.                                                                 
                                                                             
    In an attempt to remove many of the noise spikes caused by telemetry     
    bit errors, raw data numbers are compared to the maximum thresholds      
    given in:

    have been eliminated from the average.  Data numbers are compared to     
    the threshold *after* any data corrections.  Near planetary              
    encounters raw values were not subject to elimiation when exceeding      
    maximum threshold values.  This is represented by using the maximum      
    possible 8-bit value, 255 as the cutoff.  Threshold filter values        
    may be changed in the future.

    The average and peak spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where      
    data are available) low resolution data set which provides wave          
    intensity as a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and

    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          
    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         
    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured field to     
    any particular direction such as the local magnetic field or             
    direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft usually           
    remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously.          
    Furthermore, even during the rare times when the spacecraft is           
    turned, the hour-long averages in this data set would almost             
    completely mask any modulation caused by the rotating dipole antenna     
    pattern."

    This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data acquired     
    during the Voyager 2 mission to date.  The data set near planetary       
    encounters has been cleaned prior to averaging for periodic noise        
    spikes due to a stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated      
    grid within the PLS.  Other spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz due to     
    the operation of attitude control thrusters have not been removed.       
    Telemetry errors appear in the full resolution data set as               
    randomly-occurring spikes over the entire frequency range.  No           
    attempt has been made to remove such spikes because of the               
    difficulty of differentiating between them and valid data, i.e. real     
    bursts of wave activity.  The spikes, therefore, can adversely           
    affect the averaged values.  The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes            
    contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument, depending on       
    that instrument's mode.  This interference is at a relatively            
    constant level.                                                          
                                                                             
    A failure in the Voyager 2 flight data system on September 24, 1977      
    has decreased the sensitivity and the calibration accuracy of the        
    upper 8 spectrum analyzer channels (i.e. 1 kiloHertz and higher).        
    One aspect of this failure is that voltages on other inputs to a         
    multiplexer shared by the PWS upper 8 channels can affect the PWS        
    data.  Hence, if all 8 upper channels move up and down together, it      
    is likely this is a side effect of the failure and not a real effect     
    in the PWS data.                                                         
                                                                             
    An intermittent failure appeared in the Voyager 2 17.8 Hz channel        
    beginning on November 6, 1995.  The channel now exhibits three           
    states.  In the original failed state, the channel becomes very          
    noisy, outputting an abnormally large signal.  In a second failed        
    state, the output goes to zero.  However, for the majority of the        
    time since the failure, the channel outputs credible measurements in     
    the correct amplitude range.                                             
                                                                             
    Beginning in May 2001 the Voyager 2 wideband receiver began to           
    display degraded operation and by September of 2002, the receiver        
    showed virtually no response.  Attempts to playback wideband data        
    from Voyager 2 have ceased.

    This archival data set was examined by a peer review panel prior to      
    its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The peer review

    Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data set, key     
    elements of the archive were distributed for preliminary review.         
    These included electronic versions of example PDS labels, CATALOG
