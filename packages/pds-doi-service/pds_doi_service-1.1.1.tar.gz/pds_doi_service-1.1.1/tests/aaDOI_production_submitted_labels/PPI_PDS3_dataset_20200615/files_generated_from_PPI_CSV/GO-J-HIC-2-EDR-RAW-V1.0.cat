    There are two basic types of data files associated with the raw data     
    archive: Packetized Telemetry (RAW) and Reformatted Raw Data             
    (UNCALIBRATED). The RAW data is the most primitive binary form           
    available to the instrument team. These data are reformatted into the    
    UNCALIBRATED data files which are ASCII (HEX) tables that are in turn    
    used by the HIC team to produce higher level data products. The          
    appropriate information concerning the operation of the instrument can   
    be found in Garrard, Gehrels and Stone, Space Sci. Rev., 60, 305, 1992   
    [GARRARDETAL1992].

    RAW DATA                                                                 
    --------                                                                 
      The data are raw binary packetized telemetry 2 data obtained from      
      the Query Server at JPL.  No further processing has been done.         
                                                                             
      Every 2 seconds the HIC instrument zeros the rate counters and         
      begins accumulation.  In playback data 3 events per minor frame are    
      selected (based on a priority scheme) and transmitted to the           
      spacecraft along with 2 - 3 rates.  Some of the less important /       
      scientifically interesting rates are subcommutated and thus only       
      transmitted once every 16 HIC packets (1 HIC x packet equals minor     
      frames).  In realtime data the rate counters are x accumulated for a   
      series (the number of which depends on the bit rate) of 2 second       
      intervals, while up to 60 events (selected by assigned priority) are   
      transmitted during this accumulation period.                           
                                                                             
      Additional information on data processing can be found in the Space    
      Research Lab technical document 86-02 (''Science Requirements          
      Document'', [GARRARD1985] which is included on the archive volume in

      The HIC instrument team included uncalibrated unprocessed data files   
      as part of their data submission.  These files are not meant for       
      users of this product but for archiving the data files used by the     
      HIC team to produce the higher quality products.

    There are no ancillary data uniquely associated with the HIC             
    raw data archive. However, the spacecraft trajectory and                 
    attitude data, and the As-run Spacecraft Events Files that are           
    provided on the same archive volume as these data are useful

      The data are stored in a rather complex and compact binary form

      This is an ASCII text file originally consisting of variable length    
      data records.  To make the records comply with PDS standards, blank    
      spaces were added to fill in when a record did not have a full set     
      of 3 data sets (see below).                                            
                                                                             
      These files contain rate and event data which are relatively           
      unprocessed and uncalibrated.                                          
                                                                             
      The first 15 data fields are consistent for each record in the data    
      file. These 15 fields contain information pertaining to: date, time,   
      observation modes and rate data.  Optional event data may appear       
      after the rate data.

      The data are stored in a rather complex and compact binary form

      This is an ASCII text file consisting of header lines followed by      
      data blocks.                                                           
                                                                             
      The first six lines are header lines.                                  
                                                                             
      Data blocks follow the header lines.  Each data block may consist of   
      up to three sections.

      Each Data Block consists of three sections.                            
                                                                             
      The first section is rate data.  This section will always be ten       
      lines followed by an optional blank line.                              
                                                                             
      The optional second section is event data.  If present, it may have    
      up to 23 lines followed by an optional blank line.                     
                                                                             
      The third section is a summary of events.

      This section has 10 lines.  Only the first line will contain the       
      date/time and SCET information for this data block.  The rest of the   
      first line has the same 14 data fields as the next nine lines.

      line. Either of these lines may be the last line in the data file.     
      This section is typically followed by the beginning of another Data    
      Block.

    The confidence level in the playback data is good to high at present.    
    There are possibly a few glitches in the time determination, but these   
    should result in obviously wrong data times when present.  We have       
    tried to eliminate such occurrences as much as possible, but are not     
    flawless in this effort.  Please direct any questions regarding the      
    generation or interpretation of the data to Christina Cohen at Caltech

    undergoing review and revision and any 'surprising'/'unbelievable'       
    results you may obtain using these data should be subject to careful     
    scrutiny, preferably with someone familiar with the instrument and its
