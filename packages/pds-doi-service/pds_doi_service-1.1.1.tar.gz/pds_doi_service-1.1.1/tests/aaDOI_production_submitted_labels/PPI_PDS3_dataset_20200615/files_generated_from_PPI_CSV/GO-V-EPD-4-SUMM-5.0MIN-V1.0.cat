This data set contains 5 minute averages for the energetic                   
particle detector rate data obtained from the LEMMS telescope during         
the time the detector was operated during the Venus encounter.  The          
data are recorded in five minute averages for each of 17 LEMMS               
channels.  (The CMS telescope was not powered up during the Venus            
encounter.)  All of the data was taken with the telescope                    
perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis (motor step position = 4).         
The rates reported are in units of counts/sec.  Each entry in the            
browse document is averaged over a five minute time span to reduce the       
amount of data more condusive for browsing.  The energetic particle          
data included in this browse set are summarized by Williams et al.
