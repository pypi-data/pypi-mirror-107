    Overview:                                                         
    =========                                                         
                                                                      
    The Electron Spectrometer (ELS) provides in situ electron         
    measurements in the energy range 0.05 eV to 20 keV to help        
    satisfy the following scientific objectives:                      
                                                                      
       1. Determine the instantaneous global distributions of plasma  
          and neutral gas near Mars by providing undisturbed solar    
          wind parameters                                             
                                                                      
       2. Define the local characteristics of the main plasma regions 
                                                                      
       3. Complement the ENA images                                   
                                                                      
    Parameters:                                                       
    ===========                                                       
                                                                      
    All ELS data products have the same format and parameters, and    
    each row (data file record) in the ELS SPREADSHEET data products  
    has eight (8) COLUMN objects (parameters):                        
       1. Start Time - Begin Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       2. Stop Time - Ending Date/Time in UTC of data samples         
       3. Data Type Name - SENSOR, SCAN, or MODE. The SENSOR rows are 
          the ELS science data for each sector (16 sectors). The SCAN 
          rows are the deflection voltages (volts) that correspond to 
          the SENSOR rows.  There is one SCAN row per 16 SENSOR rows. 
          The 16 SENSOR rows are followed by one corresponding SCAN   
          row.  The SCAN row indicates the deflection voltage per     
          step that corresponds to the previous 16 SENSOR rows for    
          each step.  To convert the deflection voltages to center    
          energies (eV), use the K_FACTOR per anode in the            
          calibration tables:  eV = volt * K_FACTOR. There are 16     
          SENSOR rows + 1 SCAN row (17 in all) followed by 23 rows of 
          MODE data for the same time period. The MODE rows contain   
          informational data such as Time/Step Summations and Sector  
          Enable Flags.                                               
       4. Data Type Id - Numeric ID indicating SENSOR, SCAN, or MODE. 
       5. Data Name - Short description for data on that row.  For    
          example 'ELS Sector 0 LR' for ELS sector 0 Low Range        
          science data (SENSOR rows for ELSSCIL data products), 'ELS  
          Sector 0 HR' for ELS sector 0 High Range science data       
          (SENSOR rows for ELSSCIH data products), 'Deflection        
          Potential' for SCAN rows, or 'Time Summation' for           
          informational data (MODE row).                              
       6. Data Unit - Indicates the data unit:                        
            'c/acc' (counts per accumulation) for SENSOR data         
            'volt' for SCAN data                                      
            'Unitless' for MODE data                                  
       7. Values - These are the actual data values.  For this column 
          there are multiple values as indicated by the ITEMS keyword 
          in the label files.  This value will vary from file to      
          file, but remains consistent within a data (.CSV) file.     
          For the SENSOR rows, these are the science data sampled at  
          the corresponding deflection volts indicated in the         
          corresponding SCAN row that follows the 16 ELS sector       
          (SENSOR rows) data.  The MODE data rows contain only one    
          value each and remaining ITEMS are indicated 'missing' with 
          commas (value,,...,,).  Please note that the data values    
          are formatted for a high level of accuracy, and that this   
          does not indicate the accuracy of the ELS instrumentation.  
       8. Data Quality Value - Quality indicator for the data on that 
          row. The data quality value is only applicable for the      
          SENSOR data. See CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE under 'Data          
          Coverage/Quality' for valid values and descriptions.

    The Standard Data Products for ELS PSA Level 1b (EDR) products    
    are:                                                              
                                                                      
       1. ELSSCIL_C_ACC - ELectron Spectrometer SCIence Low range     
          data in Counts / ACCumulation units.                        
                                                                      
       2. ELSSCIH_C_ACC - ELectron Spectrometer SCIence High range    
          data in Counts / ACCumulation units.                        
                                                                      
       NOTE:  There is not a one-to-one correspondence between the    
              ELSSCIL and ELSSCIH data products. Most of the time,    
              both products are produced for the same time period.    
              However, there are times when only ELSSCIL products are 
              produced or only ELSSCIH products are produced, not     
              both.

    It is important for ASPERA-3 science studies to know where in     
    space and time the Mars Express spacecraft and ASPERA-3           
    instruments are located and what objects (Sun, Mars, Earth,       
    Phobos, Deimos) are in the fields of views. The ASPERA-3 view     
    directions for each sensor can be derived using the SPICE kernels 
    and software. The ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information 
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides a code example (in C    
    and FORTRAN) for determining the view directions for the ASPERA-3 
    sensors.

    The ASPERA-3 data are always in the instrument reference frame    
    since data are sampled in situ. The GEOMETRY table contains       
    spacecraft related parameters expressed in the J2000 reference    
    frame, and the ASPERA-3 Sensor Frames and Geometry Information    
    document (in DOCUMENT directory) provides information for         
    determining the ASPERA-3 sensors view directions and transforming 
    to the J2000 reference frame.
