Description of the PDS LECP Neptune Scan data.                                
                                                                              
     This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                 
Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft                
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet               
Neptune.  The period covered is 1989-08-24T00:00:00.000 SCET  to              
1989-08-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series           
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available

the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                    
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,              
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                     
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged               
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are               
time averaged over an arbitrary period (12 or 24 sec, see below)              
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                  
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 48 or 96                  
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called               
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                    
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                 
during the scanning periods.                                                  
                                                                              
   Three scanning situations occurred during the time of this                 
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                 
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;                
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), 2) a special                    
Neptune scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, 1, scan,            
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 and the 1 represent 5.2                    
minute periods when the instrument is fixed in sectors 7 or 1,                
respectively, and where the word scan represents a period                     
of scanning (6 sec stepping for a total scan time of 48 sec);                 
and 3) periods when the detectors are fixed for more extended                 
periods in sector 7 (periods bracketing the ring plane crossings).            
For this Neptune Scan data, the 6.4 minute scan records during                
stepping mode (1) have been time averaged to 12.8 minute records.             
Also, during stepping mode (2), the double scans that have no                 
fixed periods between them have been averaged together into                   
a single (96 sec) record.  The single scans represent 48 sec                  
records.  The schedule for the three stepping modes is as                     
follows:                                                                      
                                                                              
       prior to day 236/1600 SCET:     Mode (1)                               
       236/1600 to 237/0239:           Mode (2)                               
       237/0239 to 237/0319:           Mode (3)                               
       237/0319 to 237/0503:           Mode (2)                               
       237/0503 to 237/0554:           Mode (3)                               
       237/0554 to 238/0400:           Mode (2)                               
       after 237/0400:                 Mode (1)                               
                                                                              
Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample                   
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data                
a disjointed appearance.                                                      
                                                                              
     Two channel sample modes also occurred during the Neptune                
encounter.  These two modes affect this data set only by changing             
the primary record time length for the LECP Experiment Data Records           
(EDR's). These time lengths have, in turn, been utilized for the              
averaging times of this data set for non-stepping periods.  The               
schedule is:

     The channel data is given in units of intensity:                         
counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                 
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                 
the raw count rates via the relation:                                         
                                                                              
                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                     
                                                                              
where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                   
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton                
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities              
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption            
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                 
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                  
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the                
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                     
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                  
V. 86, page 8227, 1981)  The corresponding parameters for electrons           
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,              
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                      
(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and              
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.                  
                                                                              
     The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with           
each channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the                   
two quantities: (i) one standard deviation Poisson statistical                
error, and (ii) a percentage assigned by the data supplier                    
based on the amount of contamination correction that has been                 
performed on each data channel.                                               
                                                                              
     Also supplied with each record of this data set is the                   
fraction of the data accumulations that correspond to each                    
of the 8 angle sectors. For example, during a sector 7 stow                   
period, this number will be 1.0 for sector 7  and 0.0 for all                 
of the other sectors.  A sector 9 has also been defined                       
corresponding to those accumulations with no known sector                     
assignment.                                                                   
                                                                              
    Additionally supplied for each data channel a one bit code                
that tells whether that channel had any accumulations at                      
all associated with it (1 = yes; 0 = no).  This code must be                  
used to distinguish between accumulations that yielded no counts              
and situations where the channel simply had no accumulations                  
(results in Intensity = 0.0).

    High quality data is available from the LECP instrument                   
throughout the time period addressed with this data set.                      
The data is subject to errors associated with Poisson                         
statistics and associated with various kinds and levels of                    
contamination. The known contaminations are: i) penetrating                   
background, ii) Solar UV contamination within the lowest energy               
ion channel when the detector faces sunward, and iii) electron                
contamination of the lower energy ion channels (the contaminating             
electrons are measured).  Corrections have been made to the data              
in attempts to remove the effects of these contaminations.                    
                                                                              
     An error parameter is given for each particle intensity                  
value given in the data set.  This error is expressed as a                    
percentage.  This number is the larger of the following                       
items: 1) the one standard deviation Poisson error, and 2) a                  
value assigned by the data supplier associated with the degree                
of correction that was required with regard to the contaminations             
listed above.                                                                 
                                                                              
     Missing data is indicated with a binary flag associated                  
with each energy channel. Each channel's flag will read 1                     
if at least one instrumental accumulation occurred for that                   
channel and for that record.  The flag reads 0 for no                         
accumulations.  This parameter must be utilized to distinguish                
between accumulations that yielded no counts, and the situation               
where there simply were no accumulations (the error parameter                 
reads 100 for both cases)."
