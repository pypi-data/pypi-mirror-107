      A caveat is that during most of the Jupiter flyby, the counting         
      rate logic was swamped by the extremely high intensity of               
      electrons contained in the magnetosphere.  As a result, we              
      believe that the most reliable interpretation of the counting           
      rates is that they become effectively measures of the integral          
      intensity above the minimum energy required for an electron to          
      penetrate to the most deeply buried detector required by the            
      counting rate logic.  For example, the H4 counting rate, which          
      is nominally defined by the coincidence D1 D2 D4 K1 N[K4 A S            
      (H)] becomes the integral intensity of all electrons with               
      sufficient energy to reach K1, which, by the table below, based         
      on the Berger and Seltzer tables and the thicknesses of the             
      D1-D6 detectors, is ~2.7 MeV.                                           
                                                                              
      The minimum electron energies required to trigger the counting          
      rates, based simply on energy required to penetrate to the              
      deepest detector and trigger its discriminator are as follows.          
      For detectors beyond the midpoint of the telescope, we have             
      assumed that there is sufficient material (instrument and               
      spacecraft) behind the telescope that the easiest access to             
      the detector is still through the front of the telescope. This          
      may not be a good assumption.                                           
                                                                              
        H1   ~0.5 MeV                                                         
        H2   ~2.6 MeV  (higher level discriminators on D1 and D2              
        H3   ~1.5 MeV                         required)                       
        H4   ~2.7 MeV                                                         
        H5   ~8.9 MeV                                                         
        H6   ~1.2 MeV                                                         
        H7   ~2.7 MeV                                                         
        H8   ~1.5 MeV                                                         
        H9   ~16 MeV                                                          
                                                                              
      The detailed coincidence logic defining these counting rates            
      is given in [SIMPSONETAL1992A]. As indicated by the ~, these            
      energies are very approximate.  Our assumption is that                  
      essentially all the counting rates, even those such as H2               
      designed to discriminate against electrons, were dominated by           
      electrons inside the magnetosphere.                                     
                                                                              
      One additional word of explanation is required.  In an                  
      ill-advised attempt to configure the HET to a mode to minimize          
      the effects of the expected high counting rates on our slow             
      logic, from approximately 1206 UT day 32 until approximately            
      0018 UT day 34, the HET S detector High Voltage was turned off,         
      effectively turning off S, and the D1 detector was replaced by          
      D3 in the counting rate logic.  (Commands C1 and C9 as                  
      described in Table 8 of [SIMPSONETAL1992A].) The intent was to          
      remove from the logic those detectors expected to be in near-           
      saturation throughout the flyby, and thus to make the counting          
      rates more interpretable.  The change was effected before               
      crossing the bowshock and magnetopause in order to establish a          
      base-line in the new configuration prior to encountering the            
      expected high fluxes in the magnetosphere.  The actual effect           
      turned out to be to increase the background in most of the              
      counting rates to such a high level that features such as up-           
      stream particles escaping from the magnetosphere were                   
      completely obscured.  After about a day and a half in this              
      mode, it was decided to return to normal mode, and we remained          
      in normal mode for the remainder of the flyby."
