This data set describes the counting rate data from detectors D1 and D2       
in the Cosmic Ray System (CRS) electron telescope (TET) on Voyager 1 during   
the Saturn encounter. The D1 detector nominally responds to electrons with    
kinetic energies above approximately 1 MeV, and the D2 detector, above        
approximately 2.5 MeV (see detector description for details).                 
                                                                              
Note that the instrument is saturated near the maximum of counting            
rate of approximately 50,000 counts/sec. When data are near saturation,       
the counting rates should be corrected for deadtime according to the formula  
in the DATA_SET_OR_INST_PARM_DESC:                                            
{corrected rate} = {uncorrected rate/(1+deadtime*{uncorrected rate}).

Each data point represents a six-second accumulation, so that the             
statistical uncertainty is obtained according to Poisson statistics by        
taking the square root of one sixth of the counting rate.  However,           
larger uncertainties are associated with the conversion from counting         
rate to flux (see the DATA_SET_OR_INST_PARM_DESC).
