The Ionopause File.  This file gives the orbit-by-orbit times and            
locations of the ionopause crossings, which are evident as sharp gradients   
in Ne at the top of the ionosphere. (These crossings always occur within 30  
minutes of periapsis, so they may be seen in the High Resolution Ne files).  
                                                                             
The ionopause and bow shock crossing times and locations are easily          
identified in the high resolution Ne measurements (Theis et al., 1980).      
These files contain the UT, altitude, latitude, SZA and local time of each   
crossing.                                                                    
                                                                             
On the dayside, the ionopause is taken (somewhat arbitrarily) at the level   
in the steep gradient of the ionopause where Ne = 1x102 cm-3.  On the        
nightside, the ionopause is selected at somewhat lower densities because     
the absence of spacecraft photoelectrons lowers the Ne measurement           
threshold.  In both cases, the intent is to identify the ionopause as the    
point where the first rise of Ne above the background density occurs.  Of    
course, the ionopause itself is not a point but is the extend region in which
the ionopause density gradient occurs."

The ionopause location is selected at that point in the steep gradient of the
ionopause where Ne crosses through the level of 1x102 cm-3.  When the        
spacecraft is in darkness, the pe background is absent and the ionospheric   
Ne is also much lower, so the ionopause is identified as the first rise in Ne
above whatever background is present.  The ionopause is identified by a      
human operator who views each high resolution Ne pass plot on an             
interactive computer terminal.  He selects the ionopause somewhat            
subjectively as the time of the first rise above the background Ne, which    
may consist of magnetosheath plasma or photoelectrons.  The 40 minute        
pass plots used for this purpose provide only a 5-10 second accuracy in      
the crossing times.  When irregularities or waviness in the ionopause        
produce several ionopause crossings, the outer most crossing is the only     
one identified."
