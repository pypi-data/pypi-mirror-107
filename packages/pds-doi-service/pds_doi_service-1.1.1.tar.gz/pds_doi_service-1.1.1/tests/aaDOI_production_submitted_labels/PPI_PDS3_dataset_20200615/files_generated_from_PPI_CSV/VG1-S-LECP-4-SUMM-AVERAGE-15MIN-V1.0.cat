      This browse data consists of resampled data from the Low                
      Energy Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 1 while            
      the spacecraft was in the vicinity of Saturn. This instrument           
      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (&#10095;26 keV          
      electrons and &#10095;30 keV ions) with various levels of                      
      discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular               
      arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are             
      included with this data set. The LECP data are globally                 
      calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are              
      time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact          
      beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the             
      LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning                   
      periods). The LECP instrument has a rotating head for                   
      obtaining angular anisotropy measurements of the medium energy          
      charged particles that it measures. The cycle time for the              
      rotation if variable, but during encounters it is always                
      faster than 15 minutes. For this browse data set only scan              
      average data is given (no angular information). The data is in          
      the form of 'rate' data which has not been converted to the             
      usual physical units. The reason is that such a conversion              
      would depend on uncertain determinations such as the mass               
      species of the particles and the level of background. Both              
      mass species and background are generally determined from               
      context during the study of particular regions. To convert              
      'rate' to 'intensity' for a particular channel one performs             
      the following tasks: 1) decide on the level of background               
      contamination and subtract that off the given rate level.               
      Background is to be determined from context and from making             
      use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield covering           
      it). 2) Divide the background corrected rate by the channel             
      geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the channel.             
      The geometric factor is found in entry                                  
      'channel_geometric_factor' as associated with each channel              
      'channel_id'. To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge          
      the mass species of the of the detected particles (for ions             
      but not for electrons). The energy band passes are given in             
      entries 'minimum_instrument_parameter' and                              
      'maximum_instrument_parameter' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and             
      are given in the form 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that               
      begin their names with the designations 'ch' these bandpasses           
      can be used on mass species that are accepted into that                 
      channel (see entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and                 
      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which            
      give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these                
      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels            
      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  
      accepted. The bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all               
      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       
      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these instructions           
      will be the particle intensity with the units:                          
      counts/(cm^2 str sec keV).

      Confidence Level Overview                                               
      =========================                                               
      At all times during this planetary encounter there exist data           
      in this data set that can be rated with the highest confidence          
      level. However, some of the channels of data are contaminated           
      by various kinds and various levels of contaminations. It is            
      therefore imperative, in using this data set, that the                  
      contamination tables within the catalog be examined. Also, not          
      all kinds of contamination have been fully documented. When in          
      doubt the data supplier must be contacted.                              
                                                                              
      Some channels are subject to serious contaminations, and many           
      of these contaminations cannot be removed except with a region-         
      by-region analysis, which has not been done for this data.              
      Thus, to use this data it is absolutely vital that the                  
      contamination types ('CONTAMINATION_ID' , 'CONTAMINATION_DESC')         
      and the levels of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID'                      
      corresponding to the definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be                
      carefully examined for all regions of study. A dead time                
      correction procedure has been applied in an attempt to correct          
      the linear effects of detector overdrive (pulse-pileup). This           
      procedure does not fix severely overdriven detectors. A                 
      procedure is available for correcting Voyager 1 LECP electron           
      contamination of low energy ion channels, but its                       
      effectiveness has been evaluated only for the Uranus data set.          
      Thus, corrections have been applied only to the Uranus data             
      set.
