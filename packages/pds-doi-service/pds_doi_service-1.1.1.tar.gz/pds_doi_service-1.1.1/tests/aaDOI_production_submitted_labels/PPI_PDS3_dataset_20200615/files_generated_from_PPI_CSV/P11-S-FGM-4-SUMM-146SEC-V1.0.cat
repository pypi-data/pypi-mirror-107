      This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded by       
      the Fluxgate Magnetometer on board the Pioneer 11 spacecraft,          
      during the Saturn encounter period.  Data include 146 second           
      averages of the magnetic field data in RK spherical coordinates        
      and spacecraft trajectory data.

      Pioneer 11, R, and Saturn spin axis, J.  X=R points away from 
      Saturn.  Y is a vector in the direction of J cross R.  Z is X 
      cross Y.  Radial direction R, points away from Saturn, polar 
      direction THETA, positive northward, and azimuthal direction, 
      PSI, parallel to the X-Y plane, positive eastward.

      Instrument Calibration                                                 
      ======================                                                 
      The fluxgate magnetometer was calibrated at the GSFC Magnetic
      Test Facility by means of a 2 meter diameter, single axis 
      Helmholtz coil system.  Typically hysteresis observed after 
      exposure to 2.5 mT fields was less than 1 part in 10**3 (one
      count).  Temperature stability is better than +- 0.5% over the
      temperature range of -20 to +40 degree Celsius in spite of the
      open loop design of the instrument.  This is due to the fact 
      that the characteristics of the magnetic material used in the
      sensor cores are fairly independent of temperature over the
      indicated range.  The stability figure includes the A/D converter
      drift and a large portion of it is due to the single ramp design 
      of the latter.  Nevertheless, minimum power consumption 
      requirements and flight qualified component availability 
      precluded the used of more stable A/D converter designs
      (ACUNA&NESS1974)."
