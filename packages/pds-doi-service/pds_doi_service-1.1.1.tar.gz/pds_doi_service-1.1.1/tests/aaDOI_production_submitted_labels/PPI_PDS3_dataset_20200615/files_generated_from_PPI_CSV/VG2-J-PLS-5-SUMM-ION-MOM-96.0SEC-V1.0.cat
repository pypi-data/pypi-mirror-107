    only accurate for high mach number flows directly into the detector, and  
    may result in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the

      This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion              
      density from Voyager 2 at Jupiter in the PLS voltage range              
      (10-5950 eV/Q). It is calculated using the method of                    
      [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of taking the            
      total measured current and dividing by the collector area and           
      plasma bulk velocity. This method is only accurate for high             
      mach number flows directly into the detector, and may result            
      in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the          
      outer magnetosphere. Thus absolute densities should be treated          
      with caution, but density variations in the data set can be             
      trusted. The low resolution mode density is used at all times           
      except day 190 2100-2200 when the larger of the high and low            
      resolution mode densities in a 96 sec period is used.                   
      Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a constant velocity            
      component of 200 km/s into the D cup is used outside of this.           
      These are the densities given in the [MCNUTTETAL1981] paper             
      corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for densities obtained           
      from the side (main) sensor. This correction is due to a                
      better calculation of the effective area of the sensors. Data           
      format: column 1 is time (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2           
      is the moment density in cm^-3. Each row has format (a24, 1x,           
      1pe9.2). Values of -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could

      A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit                
      volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge, or          
      energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or               
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             
      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               
      limitations.                                                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           
      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   
      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          
      provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             
      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               
      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    
      densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian             
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          
      sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each           
      Maxwellian is given.

      =========================                                               
      This data set provides an estimate of the positive ion charge           
      density. Several assumption/simplifications are made to                 
      simplify the analysis which may affect the accuracy of the              
      results. High mach number flow is assumed; mach numbers of              
      2-3, which are reasonable lower limits for heavy ions, result           
      in 10-20% underestimates of the charge density. The analysis            
      assumes a unit response (ie., all particles in a cold beam              
      incident on the aperture of the experiment would be measured            
      at the collector). The actual response is documented in                 
      [MCNUTTETAL1981] and can be as low as 70%. A velocity into the          
      detector must also be assumed; the velocity used is the                 
      corotation velocity inside of 17.5 R[J] and 200 km/s outside            
      of this. This velocity profile is in accord with that measured          
      where velocity determinations are possible, but the use of              
      incorrect values give errors in the density which vary linearly         
      with errors in the velocity. Finally, only ions in the PLS              
      energy range (10-5950 eV/Q) are counted. The cumulative error           
      from all these effects is less than 10% in the solar wind, less         
      than a factor of two in the outer magnetosphere (r&#10095;20 R[J]) and         
      less than 20-30% inside of this. Since the amplitude of each of         
      these effects varies slowly in time (distance), the relative            
      changes in density are good to a few percent in most cases.
