      A derived parameter equaling the number of electrons per unit           
      volume over a specified range of electron energy. Different             
      forms of electron density are distinguished by method of                
      derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of moments) or by some               
      selection criteria (ie., hot electron and cold electron                 
      density). In general, if more than one electron component is            
      analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density will be              
      provided which is the sum of the electron densities. If the             
      electrons do not have a Maxwellian distribution the actual              
      distribution can be represented as the sum of several                   
      Maxwellians, in which case the density of each Maxwellian is            
      given.

      A derived parameter giving an indication of the mean                    
      energy/electron, assuming the shape of the electron energy              
      derived spectrum to be Maxwellian. Given that the electron              
      energy spectrum is not exactly Maxwellian, the electron                 
      temperature can be defined integrally (whereby the mean energy          
      obtained by integrating under the actual electron energy                
      spectrum is set equal to the integral under a Maxwellian,               
      where the temperature is a free parameter for which to solve),          
      or differentially (whereby the slopes of the actually electron          
      energy spectrum at various energies are matched to the slopes           
      of a corresponding Maxwellian).                                         
                                                                              
      The temperature parameter is often qualified with a range of            
      applicable energies. Temperatures can be angularly                      
      anisotropic. If the electrons do not have a Maxwellian                  
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          
      sum of several Maxwellians, each with a separate temperature.

      Confidence Level Overview                                               
      =========================                                               
      This data set provides the best estimate available of the               
      total electron density in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV).            
      Four assumptions were made 1) secondary electrons escaping              
      from the collector plate of the detector were neglected; 2)             
      extrapolations were made to estimate the number of electrons            
      outside the PLS energy range; 3) electrons were assumed to              
      have isotropic distributions; 4) where the spacecraft                   
      potential was small the shape of the thermal electron spectra           
      was used to estimate the charge and correct the derived                 
      densities. 1) should result in an underestimate of the                  
      electron density by no more than 10% for T[e] &#10094; 100 eV and no           
      more than 30% for T[e] &#10095; 100 eV. 2) gives uncertainties of at           
      most 10%, and usually much smaller, for T[e] = 5-3000 eV which          
      is the T[e] range measured in this region. 3) should be an              
      excellent assumption since isotropization times for electrons           
      are fast, and since the electron thermal speed is always much           
      greater than the plasma flow speed. 4) in regions where the             
      spacecraft charge is positive, charging produces uncertainties          
      of at most 10%. Values of T[e] in all regions have                      
      uncertainties approximately equal to the density                        
      uncertainties.
