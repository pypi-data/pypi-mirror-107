      This file is a listing of particle energy spectra from the
      Galileo Plasma Instrument (PLS) during the second Earth
      Encounter.  Detector reponses from ion detetors 2P, 4P, and

      PDS as separate files.  The energy resolution, angular fields
      of view, and nominal geometric factors for the detectors are
      specified in the Instrument Description file.

  Data Set Overview
  =================
    For each detector the responses (Counts/Sample-Period) are given
    for a series of energy-per-unit charge steps (E/Q, Volts).  These
    responses are summed over spin sectors.  The instrument is
    programmable, and operating modes are tailored for different mission
    phases to acquire effective measurements.  The E/Q steps and Sample
    Periods for different mission phases (through Ida) are tabled below.
