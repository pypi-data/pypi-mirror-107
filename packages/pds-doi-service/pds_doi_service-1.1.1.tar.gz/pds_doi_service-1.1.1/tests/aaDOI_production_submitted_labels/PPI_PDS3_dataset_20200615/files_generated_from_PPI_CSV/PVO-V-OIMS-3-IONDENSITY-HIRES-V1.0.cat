=================                                                            
The PV-OIMS high resolution dataset contains data from the Orbiter           
Ion Mass Spectrometer (OIMS) experiment and orbit attitude data for          
orbits 1-5055, including data for the period periapsis +/- 30 minutes        
for each orbit. The dataset is divided into multiple files which             
contain 1 orbit. The user should be able to easily get to any desired        
orbit by selecting the appropriate file.                                     
                                                                             
Data                                                                         
====                                                                         
The data are provided in fixed length records (ASCII) with each              
record consisting of 119 data elements totaling 843 bytes. The               
record structure is described below. Each record represents one              
complete OIMS experiment data cycle (normally 6.3 seconds but this           
time can vary with the bit rate). Within each record there are 55            
samples of mass and the density associated with that mass. The               
sequence of masses within a record will normally follow the OIMS             
'explore' mode, but this sequence may vary when the experiment is            
occasionally in the 'explore-adapt' mode.                                    
                                                                             
To compute the time associated with a particular mass and density,           
the dwell time element (element 5) should be used along with the time        
of day (element 3).  The dwell time is time interval (milliseconds)          
between samples. Thus, for the 'Nth' sample, the time would be               
computed as follows:                                                         
                                                                             
TIME = UT = (N - 1) * DWELL/1000 (where UT is the time of day)               
                                                                             
The user should be aware that some of the densities have been coded.         
For example, the values 999 and 9.9999e+04 are the missing data values       
for mass and density, respectively, for that point. (This can be due         
to several reasons such as telemetry interference or a gap in the            
data occurred.) Also, a negative value of density represents a               
'flagged' data point and should be used with caution.
