  The spatial resolution of the grid (0.25 x 0.25 degrees) is much

  Sampling:                                                                   
  =========                                                                   
                                                                              
  The measured parameters consist of the three vector components              
  of the lunar crustal magnetic field in East, North, and Radial (ENR)        
  coordinates, and the field magnitude at an altitude of 37 km.  The          
  units of the field measurements are nanoTeslas (nT). 1 nT = 0.00001         
  Gauss.  ENR coordinates are centered at the instantaneous spacecraft        
  location with X directed eastward, Y directed northward, and Z directed     
  radial to the Moon.                                                         
                                                                              
  The constant spacecraft altitude is estimated by subtracting the mean       
  lunar radius (1738 km) from the radial distance of the spacecraft           
  to the lunar center of figure.                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
  ====================================================================        
  Processing:                                                                 
  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
  Step 1:  The Level 3 MAG data (two-dimensional, filtered regional field     
  maps at the spacecraft altitude) are continued to a common altitude.        
  Only those maps produced at relatively low altitudes (less than 50 km)      
  during the extended mapping phase of the LP mission are processed to        
  obtain maximum accuracy and horizontal resolution.  Only upward             
  continuation is applied in order to prevent amplification of data           
  errors by the continuation procedure.  The upward continuation was          
  accomplished by applying a simple power law algorithm to each field         
  component on the regional maps.  The exponent for the power law was         
  determined empirically by comparing measured field components at            
  several different altitudes over the same regions.  The field magnitude     
  is calculated from the smoothed component files on the same                 
  two-dimensional grid.  The resulting two-dimensionally filtered             
  gridded files at a common altitude are the Level 4 data.  They              
  contain latitude, longitude, the field component in nT (or the              
  altitude in km), and the number of data points in each bin.                 
                                                                              
  Step 2:  If a significant longitudinal gap between                          
  usable orbit segments is present, linear interpolation between the          
  two nearest orbit segments is applied to create an interpolated             
  orbit segment.  This interpolated segment is then read into the             
  two-dimensional filtering code to fill in the missing grid values.          
  This method is applied only when the gap between usable orbits is           
  smaller than the 5-bin size of the two-dimensional filter.  Where           
  possible, the resulting regional gridded files at a common altitude         
  are joined together to construct larger-scale gridded files.                
                                                                              
  Step 3:  For visualization purposes, a suitable                             
  graphics utility is applied to construct regional shaded contour plots      
  of the vector components of the crustal field and the field magnitude.      
  These are contained in .tif files that are included with the filtered       
  gridded files in appropriate subdirectories identifying their location      
  on the Moon.  The .tif files are labeled in the format east.tif,            
  north.tif, radial.tif, and total.tif.  The contour interval on all          
  field plots isfield plots is 2 nT.  (Note:  On the PDS disk volume,         
  the graphics files are JPEG files and are under the BROWSE directory.)

     c is the letter N, S, E or W, indicating a compass direction             
       (this also tells you whether the aaa and bbb are latitude              
       or longitude; for example, if c is E, then aaa-bbb must                
       be east longitude);                                                    
     ddd indicates which field component is mapped in the file

   File name example:  B_120-180E_RAD.TAB describes the radial

   Column 4: Number of data points in this latitude/longitude bin.

  ============                                                                
                                                                              
  The quality of the measurements is a strong function of the                 
  spacecraft altitude, which varies from a minimum of about 80 km             
  during the first year of the mission to a minimum of about 15 km during     
  the final six months of the mission.  The best crustal field measurements   
  were therefore obtained during the final ``extended mission'' phase         
  when the orbit periapsis was lowest.  The surface resolution of the         
  measurements is normally of the same order as the spacecraft altitude.      
  At the lowest altitudes (about 15 km), the resolution is limited also       
  by the orbit track separation, which is approximately 30 km at the lunar    
  equator.  The accuracy to which the crustal field is measured at a single   
  point along the spacecraft trajectory is limited by residual external       
  field variations and is approximately 0.1 nT.  The upward continued         
  field maps at 37 km altitude have essentially the same horizontal           
  resolution and accuracy as the Level 3 regional maps (about 25 km and       
  0.1 nT, respectively).

  The coverage of the measurements over the lunar surface is limited to       
  those areas on the near and far side when the Moon and the LP spacecraft    
  were favorably located to allow direct measurements of the crustal
