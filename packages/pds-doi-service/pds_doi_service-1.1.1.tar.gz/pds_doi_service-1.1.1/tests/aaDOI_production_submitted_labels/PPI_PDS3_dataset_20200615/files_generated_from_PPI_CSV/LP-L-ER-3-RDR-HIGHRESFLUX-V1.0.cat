    The Electron Reflectometer high resolution (ERHR) data set is a time      
    ordered series of electron measurements from the Lunar Prospector         
    (LP) Mission.  Each record consists of a time tag with 2 scalar data      
    points representing measurements of the electron flux in 2 different      
    energy channels, typically 140 and 340 eV, with an energy resolution      
    of 25%. Each data point is a measure of the electron flux (cm-2 sec-1     
    ster-1 eV-1) averaged over 4-pi steradians.  These data are               
    accumulated over 1/2 spin (~2.5 sec) and are measured continuously.       
                                                                              
    These data are intended to be used in conjunction with LP                 
    Magnetometer (MAG) data records, which provide the magnetic field         
    vector as a function of time.  Electrons travel along the magnetic        
    field lines in tight helices (few km radius) at high speed (roughly       
    one Mars diameter per second).  Thus the electron data contain            
    information about the plasma environment as well as the large-scale       
    configuration of the magnetic field, which is sampled locally by the      
    MAG.                                                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Parameters:

    The ERHR data are provided as differential electron flux in units of      
    particles per square cm per second per steradian per electron volt.       
    ERHR measurements are recorded at 2 different energies, typically 140     
    and 340 eV.  The energy sweep was changed several times during the        
    mission for both instrumental and scientific reasons.  A record of        
    these sweep changes is provided in a detached table, with energies        
    given in electron volts.                                                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Processing:                                                                 
  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
    Processing is carried out at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) of       
    the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), to convert the raw data     
    to measurements of the omnidirectional electron flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1     
    eV-1) as a function of time.  Because of the instrument's high            
    dynamic range (six decades), the onboard digital processing unit          
    (DPU) compresses the raw counts in a logarithmic scale.  The first        
    step is to decompress the raw counts and construct a two-dimensional      
    data array, where the first dimension is time (1 element every 1/2        
    spin), and the second dimension is energy (2 elements).                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Raw count rate (R) is obtained by dividing the raw counts by the          
    integration time, which is a function of energy.  In general terms,       
    the integration time is longer at higher energies in order to improve     
    counting statistics.  The data are next corrected for deadtime.           
    During the time it takes the instrument to process a single electron      
    (known as the ''deadtime'', which is about 0.3 microsec for the ER),      
    it ignores any other electrons.  The raw count rate is multiplied by      
    the factor 1/(1 - RT), where T is the deadtime, to obtain the             
    corrected count rate.  Data values are masked when the deadtime           
    correction factor exceeds 1.25.  Note that a background count rate        
    due to cosmic rays and noise in the electronics (about 10 counts/sec)     
    has not been subtracted.  In most cases, measurements in the highest      
    energy channel (20 keV) are dominated by background, which allows         
    this channel to be used as a baseline for estimating the background       
    level in lower energy channels.  (The ER low resolution data set can      
    be used for this purpose.)  Finally, one divides by the geometric         
    factor (0.02 cm2 ster) and the center energy (eV) to obtain the           
    differential particle flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1).

    Data are archived on CDROMs in level 1 compliance with the ISO            
    9660 standard. Most CDROMs contain 23 days of data. The data              
    set consists of two types of ASCII tables: data and energy                
    bins. The data are provided as ASCII ''tables'' of 1 day                  
    duration. Fluxes are provided for 2 energy bins (~140 & 340 eV)           
    collected over a single spacecraft spin (~5 sec). The electron            
    reflectometer section of the instrument samples 4 pi steradians           
    twice each spin period. The second table is a collection of the           
    energy bin values. The instrument can be commanded to acquire             
    data in a number of different sets of energy bins. In practice,           
    the energy bins are not changed frequently. The times and new             
    set of energy bins are recorded in this second table.

  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    The ERHR data are intended to be used in conjunction with                 
    magnetic field and spacecraft ephemeris data.  Electrons travel           
    along the magnetic field lines in tight helices (few km radius)           
    at high speed (roughly one Mars diameter per second).  Thus the           
    electron data contain information about the plasma environment            
    as well as the large-scale configuration of the magnetic field,           
    which is sampled locally by the MAG.                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Data Quality:                                                               
  ============                                                                
                                                                              
    The ERHR data are generally of very high quality.  Three                  
    instrumental effects should be noted. (1) Sunlight directly               
    enters the ER aperture twice per spacecraft spin.  These photons          
    scatter within the instrument and produce secondary electrons,            
    which cause spurious counts.  These counts have not been                  
    removed. (2) Electron fluxes are relatively high at low                   
    energies, and at times the instrument becomes saturated.                  
    A deadtime correction of the form 1/(1 - RT) is applied, where R          
    is the measured count rate and T is the time needed to analyze a          
    single electron.  This correction is only reliable up to values           
    of about 1.25, above which data are flagged.  (3) Low energy              
    electrons can be perturbed by the spacecraft floating potential           
    relative to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  In           
    sunlight, the spacecraft floats a few volts positive, and in              
    the Moon's shadow, it floats tens of volts negative.  Electrons           
    must cross this potential before they enter the ER electrostatic          
    optics, thus all electron energies are shifted by this potential          
    relative to their energies far from the spacecraft.  No                   
    corrections are made for spacecraft potential effects.

  =============                                                               
                                                                              
    ERHR data are obtained continuously; however, telemetry gaps do           
    occur. A table of gaps in the raw merged telemetry data                   
    (OUTAGES.TAB) is provided with this data set as a rough                   
    indication of the data coverage. Other gaps may exist due to              
    data contamination or processing limitations."
