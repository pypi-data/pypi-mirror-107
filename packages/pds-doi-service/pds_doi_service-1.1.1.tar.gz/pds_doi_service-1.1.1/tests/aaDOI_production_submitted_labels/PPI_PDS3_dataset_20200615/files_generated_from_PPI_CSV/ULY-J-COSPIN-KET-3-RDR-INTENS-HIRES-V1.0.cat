             flag of -9.99e+10 if intensity can not be determined            
                                                                             
       IMPORTANT:                                                            
                                                                             
      1. Only rates are given for the electrons, since no simple             
         estimate of the intensities can be done. Intensities must           
         derived from Pulse-Height Analysis.                                 
                                                                             
      2. Background Fluxes of K1 are a combination of components,            
         including a high RTG background rate. This channel should be        
         used only during event times, during quiet times flux is            
         mostly set to -9.99e+10.                                            
                                                                             
      3. On 10 min averages some of the channels have limitations            
         because of RTG background subtraction on this short time            
         scale. Time periods with lower fluxes are available from            
         the PI. Very slowly increases are a sign that background            
         levels are reached (few percent per year).

      4. A first order correction of the counting rates in K3, K34           
         and K33 is made. If you are looking at low fluxes especially        
         in K33, please ask for data on a longer accumulation period.

      5. Fluxes of K11, K13_K20 and E4 below 2.0e-4, 2.5e-3 are a            
         combination of different components including RTG back-             
         ground. The exact amount of background relative to real             
         electrons are unknown.                                              
                                                                             
         Levels below 3.0e-3, 2.5e-3 should not be considered.               
                                                                             
      6. Fluxes of K32 are contaminated by high energy protons.              
         Reliable fluxes needs an PHA correction on longer                   
         accumulation periods.
