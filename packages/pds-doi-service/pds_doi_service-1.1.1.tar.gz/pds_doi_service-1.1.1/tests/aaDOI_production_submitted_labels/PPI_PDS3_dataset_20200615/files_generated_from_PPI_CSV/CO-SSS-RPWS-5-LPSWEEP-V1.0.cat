  ==========                                                                 
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were     
    compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the RPWS      
    flight software onboard, apply conversion lookup tables or               
    algorithms to convert telemetry data numbers into physical units,        
    and make any corrections required for antenna capacitive loading or      
    other effects.  See chapters 5 - 11 of the RPWSCAL document in the       
    DOCUMENT directory for details on how the data included in this data     
    set were calibrated.  These data are calibrated using the best           
    calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data         
    were archived.  Should a significant improvement in calibration          
    become available, an erratum will be noted in the erratum section.       
    Later versions of the products may contain better calibrations.  The     
    sweep data itself consist of 0.5s long current-voltage                   
    characteristics (usually every 24s during Titan flybys) and in the       
    voltage range +/-4V (for flybys above 1200km altitude, +/-32V has        
    been used).  The voltage sweeps are swept from both negative and         
    positive voltage bias (i.e., two sweeps occur per 0.5s) to check         
    for  hysteresis artifacts. Very few were found, and corrected for.       
    The analysis of the current-voltage characteristics has been made        
    with Orbit Motion Limited (OML) theory using a non-linear least          
    square fitting routine. The ions and photoelectrons part (negative       
    bias) was first removed (linear fit), before fits were made for the      
    electron part (positive bias). Up to three electron components were      
    found, but only the dominant population results were kept for            
    archiving.  Sheath-Limited (SL) fits were made to confirm the            
    validity of the  output parameter results. SL features are detected      
    in the sweeps near closest approach of Titan (dense plasma).

    The data in this data set are thermal plasma parameters derived from     
    current-voltage relationships measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe.       
    These parameters are presented as detected by the sensor and are not     
    rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE          
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the           
    spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in           
    analyzing these data.  However, for most purposes, the parameters        
    may be considered point measurements at Cassini (they are at most        
    0.5s long) and may be entirely adequate with no coordinate               
    transformations at all.

    This data set contains thermal plasma parameters derived from            
    Langmuir probe voltage sweeps acquired by the Cassini RPWS               
    instrument for the interval described below. Every effort has been       
    made to ensure that all data returned to JPL from the spacecraft is      
    included and that the calibration is accurate.  Thermal electron         
    output data will usually not be available, due to photoelectron          
    current contamination, for number densities below  1 cm**-3 and/or       
    for temperatures above 10eV, i.e. outside the ionosphere of Titan.       
    Data &#10094; 1 cm**-3 and/or &#10095; 10 eV should be regarded as uncertain.          
    Electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be regarded as uncertain,      
    as the rms electric field surface variability of the spherical TiN       
    coated probes is 0.015eV, and the number of sweep samples used for       
    the temperature estimation becomes small (4-5 samples out of 1024        
    samples over +/-4V). The sampled probe current amplitude determines      
    the confidence of the  output parameters. For electron densities         
    &#10095;100 cm**-3 the confidence level is better than 10% for the electron     
    density and spacecraft  potential, while it is better than 20% for       
    the electron temperature.

    The RPWS Langmuir probe sweep output data will be reviewed               
    internally by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS. The     
    data set will also be peer reviewed by the PDS.                          
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data Coverage and Quality                                                  
  =========================                                                  
    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our         
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness. In general, the        
    RPWS/LPR instrument was operated continuously most of the time from      
    SOI and forward, and gave higher resolution data during each moon        
    flyby.  Data gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply     
    to  downlink gaps, some of which were imposed by limitations on DSN      
    station availability.                                                    
                                                                             
    The following Titan flybys have NO valid RPWS/Langmuir probe sweep       
    data:

    Data from T101 and forward are TBD.                                      
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps have interference in       
    individual sweep samples.  These samples have been filtered away         
    before analysis and should not pose a problem for the delivered          
    output parameters. The RPWS HFR receiver produces interference           
    signals in the LPR in certain negative bias voltage ranges. These do     
    not affect the analysis on the electron  (positive bias voltage          
    side), and cause otherwise no significant error in the derived ion       
    parameters.                                                              
                                                                             
    Thermal electron output data will usually not be available, due to       
    photoelectron current contamination, for number densities below 1        
    cm**-3 and/or for temperatures above 10eV, i.e. outside the              
    ionosphere of Titan. Data &#10094; 1 cm**-3 and/or &#10095; 10 eV should be            
    regarded as uncertain.  Electron temperatures below 0.03eV should be     
    regarded as uncertain, as the rms electric field surface variability     
    of the spherical TiN coated probes is 0.015eV, and the number of         
    sweep samples used for the temperature estimation becomes small (4-5     
    samples out of 1024 samples over +/-4V).
