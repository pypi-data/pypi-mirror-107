      This data set consists of the JUNO JEDI (Jupiter Energetic-Particle     
      Detector) uncalibrated observations, also known as EDRs. The system     
      is made up of 3 instrument subsystems (pucks) aligned in three          
      directions on the spinning JUNO spacecraft. The pucks each have 6 look  
      directions (telescopes) with a time of flight (TOF) and a deposited     
      energy detection (SSD) system.  In addition, the pulse height of the    
      signal in the TOF system can be used for energy measurement. The        
      instruments can be operated in a variety of modes, differing in the     
      way they use and combine these measurements. More details are available 
      in the INSTRUMENT.CAT file and the JEDI SIS.                            
                                                                              
      The EDRs are organized in files covering one day of spacecraft event    
      time (SCET). There are potentially 10 different files per puck,         
      corresponding to the available data gathering modes: HIERSESP,          
      HIERSISP, HIERSTOFXER, HIERSTOFXPHR, LOERSESP, LOERSISP, LOERSTOFXER,   
      LOERSTOFXPHR, NONPTOFXER, NONPTOFXPHR. Depending on how the pucks are   
      operated, not all data types will be available for all pucks for any    
      particular time range."

      The data set consists of uncalibrated observations, also known as       
      EDRs.                                                                   
                                                                              
      For all the EDR products there is a detached PDS label file that        
      describes the contents of one data file. Each label file will have      
      the same base name as the data file it is describing, with the          
      extension .LBL to denote a label file. The label file defines the       
      start time and end of the observation, product creation time, and       
      the structure of the ASSCI tables. Each data product                    
      is identified within the PDS label by a STANDARD_DATA_PRODUCT_ID        
      value, shown in parentheses in the table below.

    ===================                                                       
      The JEDI sensors consists of a 60-mm diameter, hockey puck-like         
      cylinder, in which a start foil and stop foil, wrapped around           
      opposite curved sides of the cylinder, constitute the TOF chamber.      
      The detectors are arranged so that each detector senses the             
      events within a given range of incidence angles. Each of the 6          
      detector modules is composed of 4 pixels: large and small ion and       
      large and small electron. See the INSTRUMENT.CAT file for more          
      information.

      The setting and interaction of the actual instrument parameters         
      used to configure the timing and modes of the collection of spectral    
      data during normal science operations are complex and a detailed        
      understanding of them is not required outside of science operations     
      team.  We present science parameters that describe the data collection  
      settings in a useable fashion:

        recommended SCET time to use for data analysis.

      a longer cadence than the Low-Res product.

      Ion spectra as measured by the SSD and the TOF systems working in       
      concert.  The High and Low Res products are defined as above and        
      contain data for energetic charged protons.  The NONP data contain      
      data for other ion species.

      Ion spectra as measured by the TOF system using the pulse height of     
      the TOF signal to measure energy (this allows us to measure lower       
      particle energies).  The High and Low Res products are defined as       
      above and contain data for energetic charged protons.  The NONP data    
      contain data for other ion species."
