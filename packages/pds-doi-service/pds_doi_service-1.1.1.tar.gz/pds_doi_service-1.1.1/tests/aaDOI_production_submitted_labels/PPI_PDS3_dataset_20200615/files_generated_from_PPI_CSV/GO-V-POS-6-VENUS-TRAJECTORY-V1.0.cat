    The Galileo trajectory data are being archived in the Venus Solar         
    Orbital (VSO) coordinate system. The VSO coordinate system is             
    basically the Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) coordinate system           
    defined appropriately for Venus.  The VSO X direction is taken along      
    the Venus - Sun line, positive towards the Sun. The VSO Z direction       
    is parallel to the normal to the Venus orbital plane about the Sun,       
    positive northward, and Y completes the right-handed set (towards         
    dusk).

    The trajectory has been derived from a Galileo SPK kernel.                
    This kernel was obtained by the PDS-PPI node from the PDS-NAIF            
    node. The code which produced the trajectory data was developed and       
    executed at PDS-PPI. This code utilized SPICE routines which were         
    developed at and distributed by PDS-NAIF. Both SPICE kernels and          
    code may be available through PDS-NAIF."
