    The instrument has detected superthermal, energetic                      
or fast ions whose energy exceeds 36 eV in the spacecraft                    
frame of reference.  These ions were observed in early orbits                
during measurements of the neutral density near periapsis, have              
an erratic and unpredictable signature, and occur at too high an             
altitude to be due to the neutral atmosphere. When the altitude              
of periapsis increased above the point where sensible neutral                
density measurements could be made, the instrument was configured            
specifically to detect superthermal ions.  In general, for orbit             
numbers 1 to 645, data were taken from the RPA mode.  The gas                
background signal with the filament on is about a factor of 10               
less in this mode than in non-RPA mode, resulting in a lower                 
detection threshold. For orbit numbers above 923, the instrument             
was deliberately configured with the filament off and non-RPA                
mode data was used. For mass 16 the RPA voltage is about +3.8                
volts. "

    The data reduction process has been described in Kasprzak                
et al. (1987). The method used to reduce the data assumes                    
cylindrical symmetry of the ion source.  In actual fact, the                 
source is asymmetrical in its angular response (Guenther, 1989).             
This can introduce as much as a factor of 2 scatter in the data.             
No simple solution has been found for modeling this asymmetry                
since the actual ion drift vector is unknown. The minimum energy             
of an ion detectable by the ONMS in this ion mode is 35.9 eV.                
The maximum transmission is assumed to occur about 10 V above                
this value.  On the nightside of Venus the spacecraft potential              
is negative and the most probable ion energy is near 40 eV.                  
                                                                             
The ion species regularly monitored include: He+, N+, O+,                    
(N+ +  CO+), and CO2+. Because of the paucity of data at other               
mass numbers only mass 16 (atomic oxygen) has been reduced to a              
flux and number density. As part of the reduction process the                
angle in the ecliptic plane of the apparent ion flow in spacecraft           
reference frame has been deduced. The flux values are estimated              
in the spacecraft reference frame relative to spacecraft ground.             
The density is computed from the flux by dividing it by a speed              
corresponding to 40 eV. No correction has been applied to the                
angle, density or flux in order to remove the effect of spacecraft           
velocity.                                                                    
                                                                             
   Several parameters result from the fit: 1) the best estimate              
of the flux for the interval (used to generate the low resolution            
(LORES) data set); 2) the phase shift of signal maximum with                 
respect to that predicted by the position of the velocity vector             
and its error; 3) the fitting parameter B (Kasprzak et al., 1987);           
and 4) the effective angle of attack.  Other items can be derived            
from this data: 1) the apparent direction of the ion flow projected          
into the ecliptic plane; and 2) one component of the ion drift               
perpendicular to the plane of axis of the ONMS and the spin axis.            
The phase angle is negative if the predicted signal maximum from             
the spacecraft velocity is ahead of the true signal maximum when             
viewed along the -Z spacecraft axis with clockwise rotation.  The            
drift component is derived from the condition that the total                 
relative velocity in the moving reference frame has no component             
perpendicular to the (ONMS axis, Z axis) plane.                              
                                                                             
    The data values of the LORES data set are sampled approximately          
once per 12 seconds based on GMT times that have been supplied by            
the Pioneer Venus Project.  Each representative data point is                
constructed using an exponentially weighted average of the data over         
a 24 second interval centered at sample point time.

   In order to fit the data a minimum of 30 points were required             
in 36 seconds. In addition, the maximum to minimum count ratio was           
required to be factor of 3 or greater in order to insure that there          
was a definitive spin modulation.  The center 12 seconds of data is          
divided by the fitting function to derive the equivalent flux for            
that point. The center of the new fitting interval is adjusted so            
that it is centered on the expected signal maximum predicted from            
the previous interval fit. As a result of this method of fitting,            
discontinuities may exist near minimum angle of attack where one             
12 second interval adjoins the next interval.
