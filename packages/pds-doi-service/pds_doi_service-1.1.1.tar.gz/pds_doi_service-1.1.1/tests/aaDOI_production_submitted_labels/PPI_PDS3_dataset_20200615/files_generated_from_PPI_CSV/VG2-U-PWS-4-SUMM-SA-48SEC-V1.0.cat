          This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data         
          within the interval of time covered. The data set has been          
          cleaned as well as possible for periodic noise spikes due           
          to a stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated            
          grid within the PLS. The averages do not include these              
          noise spikes. Other possible sources of noise which have            
          not been eliminated include random intense spikes of noise          
          below 1 kiloHertz due to the operation of attitude control          
          thrusters. Other randomly occurring spikes or time periods          
          of intense spikes over the entire frequency range are               
          indicative of telemetry errors. No attempt has been made to         
          remove spikes since some could be valid data, i.e. real             
          bursts of wave activity. The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes           
          contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument,               
          depending on that instrument's mode. This interference is           
          at a relatively constant level. A failure in the Voyager 2          
          flight data system a few months after launch has decreased          
          the sensitivity and the calibration accuracy of the upper 8         
          spectrum analyzer channels (i.e. 1 kiloHertz and higher)."
