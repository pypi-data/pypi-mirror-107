  Data Set Overview
  =================

This data set contains data that is useful for determining
the energetic particle environment experienced by the Mars Science
Laboratory rover at the surface of Mars. The RDR data products are 
calibrated data reconstructed from EDR data and formatted 
according to the RAD RDR Software Interface Specification (RDR 
SIS). 	 


  Processing
  ==========

The Committee On Data Management and Computation (CODMAC) data 
level numbering system is used to describe the processing level of 
the RDR data product.  RAD RDR data products are considered CODMAC Level 
3 or Calibrated Data (equivalent to NASA level 1-A) products.  The RDR 
data files are generated from RAD EDR data.  RDR data files are ASCII 
text, and each one spans either a Sol (if data is from the surface - 
after landing) or an Earth day (if data is from cruise to Mars).  
EDR data is first ingested into the RAD team's database, and then 
RDR files are created from this data, enabling straightforward 
sorting by Sol or date. 


  Data
  ====

Each RAD RDR product consists of two files.  The first file is an 
ASCII formatted detached PDS label. The second file is an ASCII 
data file for a RAD Sol/date.  The data in a RAD RDR file is derived 
from RAD EDR data, but numeric information is uncompressed, 
calibrated to physical units, and converted to ASCII.  The data is 
presented in a generally human-readable form, but lines can be 
very long in order to maintain machine-readability as well.	


  Software
  ========

No software support is provided.


  Media/Format
  ============

The data set will be delivered and kept online.

RDR Data have been reviewed by the RAD team and/or software to 
check for data set completeness and screened for non-physical 
values such as negative energy.  RAD finds no obvious errors in 
the data at this time."
