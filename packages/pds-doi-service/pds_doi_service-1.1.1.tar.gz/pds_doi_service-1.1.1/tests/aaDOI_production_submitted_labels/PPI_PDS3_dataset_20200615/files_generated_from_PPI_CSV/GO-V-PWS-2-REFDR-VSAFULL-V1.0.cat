    This data set includes full resolution electric and magnetic wave spectra
    obtained during the ~ 53-minute period that the Galileo plasma wave      
    receiver was operated at Venus.  In addition waveform survey data        
    (uncalibrated) and all instrument housekeeping data are included.  The   
    parameters provided for both the electric and magnetic field spectral    
    data are uncalibrated data numbers.  Software and calibration tables     
    provided as part of this data set allow for fully calibrated data for    
    the electric field measurements in raw data numbers, voltage at the      
    antenna inputs (V), electric field (V/m), electric field spectral density
    (V**2/m**2/Hz), or power flux (W/m**2/Hz).  The magnetic field           
    measurements can be provided in units of magnetic field spectral density 
    (nT**2/Hz).  The sources of these data are the High Frequency Receiver,  
    Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum Analyzer which make up the Low    
    Rate Science portion of the PWS.  During the included time interval,     
    the instrument cycled between the electric and magnetic antennas for the 
    Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer.  The High Frequency  
    Receiver is always connected to the electric antenna.  Hence, for the    
    Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer, the temporal         
    resolution for electric measurements is basically one spectrum per 37.33 
    seconds.  For the High Frequency Receiver, the time between spectra is   
    18.67 seconds.  Note that the lowest 14 High Frequency Receiver channels 
    are sampled twice per 18.67 seconds while the remaining channels are     
    sampled only once.  The four Spectrum Analyzer channels are each sampled 
    7 times in an 18.67 sec interval.                                        
                                                                             
    The waveform survey data are generated by the wideband receiver portion  
    of the Plasma Wave Instrument.  These data are 4-bit measurements of the 
    voltage across the preamplifier input at a rate of 201.6 k, 25.2 k or 3.2
    k samples per second (for the 80 kHz, 10 kHz, and 1 kHz bandwidth modes, 
    respectively) using either the electric dipole or magnetic search coil   
    antennas.  An automatic gain control receiver is used to set the gain at 
    an optimum value so as to make the best use of the limited dynamic range 
    afforded by the 4-bit analog-to-digital converter.  In principle, it is  
    possible to use the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) readout contained in the
    data set to calibrate this voltage, but this capability does not         
    currently exist for this data set.                                       
                                                                             
    During the limited time of this data set, Galileo was skimming very close
    to the Venusian bow shock and actually executed several shock crossings  
    during this time.  The plasma wave data included in this data set are    
    summarized by Gurnett et al. [1991]."

    This data set includes all available Low Rate Science spectrum analyzer  
    data within the interval of time covered.  Included in this data set are 
    data quality flags which indicate whether the parity of the data value   
    was good or bad.  A bad parity flag indicates an error in the data value 
    and the software provided with this data set will ignore such values.    
    However, this is a simple parity scheme, hence, even numbers of bit      
    errors will not be flagged as being bad.  The magnetic spectra contain   
    narrowband interference lines at 2.4 kHz and harmonics.  Missing data are
    indicated by zero."
