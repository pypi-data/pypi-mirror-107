AVERAGE INTERVAL   =     00:00:24.000"

The instrument noise level (and hence sensitivity) is determined             
by the ambient environment at the time of observation.  Photo-               
electrons emitted from various spacecraft surfaces appear to be              
a strong source of electric field interference.  As a consequence            
data acquired when the spacecraft is in sunlight often are contaminated      
by spin modulated interference, especially when the spacecraft is            
in the low density solar wind, where the Debye length is several             
meters.  The noise is usually lowest when the antenna elements               
are in the spacecraft shadow.  The noise level is also reduced               
when the spacecraft is deep within the dayside ionosphere,                   
where the Debye length is much smaller than the antenna size.                
The noise is not present when the spacecraft is within the                   
optical shadow of the planet.  In this case, however, additional             
noise features are observed (mainly at 100 Hz) when the                      
spacecraft is at low altitude within the nightside ionosphere.  This         
interference is readily discriminated in the high resolution data,           
where the noise is present as a sharp pulse occurring twice per              
spin.                                                                        
The averaging scheme used can be subject to temporal aliasing when           
the data rate is sufficiently low, such that only one or two data            
are obtained per 24 second interval.  Since the sampling interval            
and spin period are not exactly synchronized, periodic noise signals,        
such as the interference, are aliased by the low sampling frequency.         
In this case the data display periodic structure, but with a period          
much longer than the spin period.                                            
The instrument was calibrated in air.  No attempt to incorporate             
changes in antenna-plasma coupling due to changes in Debye                   
length have been included in the data processing."
