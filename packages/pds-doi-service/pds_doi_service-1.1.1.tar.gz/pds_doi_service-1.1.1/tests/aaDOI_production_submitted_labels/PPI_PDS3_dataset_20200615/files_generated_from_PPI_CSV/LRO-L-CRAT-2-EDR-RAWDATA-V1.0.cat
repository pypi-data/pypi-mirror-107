    The Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) is a      
    stacked detector-absorber cosmic-ray telescope designed to answer key    
    questions to enable future human exploration of the Solar System.        
    CRaTER's primary measurement goal is to measure directly the average     
    lineal energy transfer (LET or 'y') spectra caused by space radiation    
    penetrating and interacting with shielding material.  Such measured LET  
    spectra are frequently unavailable.  In the absence of measurements,     
    numerical models are used to provide estimates of LET; the reliability of
    the models require experimental measurements to provide a ground truth.  
                                                                             
    The CRaTER Level 0 dataset consists of files containing the raw primary  
    science, secondary science, and housekeeping telemetry packets and packet
    headers created by the instrument.  The Level 0 data are meant to be used
    only for archival purposes in order to reconstruct the other CRaTER data 
    products in the future, should that become necessary.  The Level 0 data  
    are not intended to be used directly in data analyses or scientific      
    investigations--the data are stored in binary data structures and have   
    not been converted to appropriate engineering or science values.  Users  
    seeking CRaTER data are strongly encouraged to use the Level 1 or Level 2
    datasets.

    CRaTER is designed to achieve characterization of the global lunar       
    radiation environment and its biological impacts and potential mitigation
    as well as investigation of shielding capabilities and validation of     
    other deep space radiation mitigation strategies involving materials.    
    CRaTER will fill knowledge gaps regarding radiation effects, provide     
    fundamental progress in knowledge of the Moon's radiation environment,   
    and provide specific path-finding benefits for future planned human      
    exploration.

    CRaTER's principal measurement is the energy deposited in the 3-pairs of 
    silicon detectors by charged particles and photons passing through the   
    instrument's 'telescope' unit.  Whenever the coulombic charge signal re- 
    sulting from the energy deposited in a detector exceeds a predefined and 
    fixed threshold, the instrument's electronics performs a detailed        
    measurement of the signals from all of the detectors.  The resulting     
    detector signal amplitudes are compared to the values of the 'lower level
    discriminators' (LLDs).  LLDs establish minimum amplitudes for signals   
    to qualify as valid charged-particle or photon interactions.  The LLD    
    values are generally set to insure that the desired charged-particle or  
    photon measurements are not contaminated by system electronic noise.     
    Seperate LLD settings are required for the thick and thin detectors due  
    to the difference in their sensitivities; the thin and thick detector    
    LLD values are reported in the 'DiscThin' and 'DiscThick' parameters as  
    part of the secondary science packet.                                    
                                                                             
    In addition to the LLD settings, measurement filtering is achieved       
    through detector coincidence requirements--the combination of detectors  
    registering valid signals to qualify as a charged-particle or photon     
    measurement 'event'.  To measure all charged particles arriving from the 
    instrument's zenith or nadir directions, for example, the coincidence    
    requirements would be valid signals in at least detectors 1, or 2, or 5, 
    or 6.  Conversely, a coincidence consisting of valid signals in all six  
    detectors would ensure only zenith- or nadir-arriving charged particles  
    with high energies are reported.  For CRaTER's six axially-coaligned     
    detectors there are 64 possible coincidence combinations.  The desired   
    set of coincidence combinations are stored as a coincidence mask         
    parameter in the instrument's memory; the coincidence mask setting is    
    reported in the 'Mask' parameter as part of the secondary science packet.
                                                                             
    To qualify as an 'event', therefore a charged particle or photon passing 
    through CRaTER's telescope must interact and deposit sufficient energy to
    generate signals with amplitudes in excess of the specified LLDs in a    
    specified combination of detectors; only data for valid 'events' are re- 
    ported in the instrument's telemetry.                                    
                                                                             
    The measured interaction event data is written as a series of primary    
    science packets to the instrument's output telemetry buffer for the      
    spacecraft to read. At ~1 second intervals CRaTER receives a timing pulse
    from the spacecraft, at which time it flushes the primary science data   
    from the output buffer and writes a secondary science packet for the     
    spacecraft to read.  Every 16 seconds a housekeeping packet is also      
    created and written to the output buffer.                                
                                                                             
    This Level 0 dataset is composed of the three types of time-sequential,  
    raw CRaTER data records: (1) primary science, (2) secondary science, and 
    (3) housekeeping.                                                        
                                                                             
    The primary science raw data consists of the signal pulse heights from   
    each of the six detectors produced during an 'event'.  The raw event data
    in the primary science packets are the scalar channel numbers output by  
    the detector-amplifier strings' analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) fol- 
    lowing signal pulse height analysis.                                     
                                                                             
    The secondary science raw data contain the majority of instrument config-
    uration settings, status flags, and event counters.  Reported configura- 
    tion settings include the last command sent to CRaTER, detector LLD set- 
    tings, and coincidence mask values.  Status flags available in the secon-
    dary science raw data include detector bias status, selected pulse am-   
    plitude range and rate for the internal calibration pulser, and detector 
    processing status.  Counters report the number of 'singles' for each de- 
    tector as well as the number of 'good', 'rejected', and total events re- 
    corded by CRaTER during the monitoring period.                           
                                                                             
    The housekeeping raw data contains the output of internal monitors used  
    to assess the operating health of the instrument, such as power supply   
    voltage monitors, detector bias voltages and bias currents, pulse ampli- 
    tudes from the internal calibration pulser, and temperatures at five     
    locations inside of the instrument's housing.  The analog output from    
    radiation monitor is also included in the housekeeping data packets.     
                                                                             
    The primary science, secondary science, and housekeeping packets are     
    written to seperate files in binary format.  Each file begins with a     
    64-byte header and continues with one or more CCSDS packets. Each packet 
    begins with a 6-byte CCSDS header that defines the type (ApID 120,       
    121, or 122) and length of the packet, followed by a 6-byte secondary    
    header containing a time tag and instrument-specific flags.  Each of the

    No confidence level information is provided for the Level 0 data since it
    consists of only the raw instrument binary data and is not intended for  
    direct use in data analyses.

    A minimal set of automated quality control steps are used by the data    
    processing system to verify the integrity of the data.  During the       
    creation of the Level 0 data files from the downlinked instrument data   
    files, each data packet's CCSDS header is checked for format and content.
    Packets are discarded if their headers are corrupted, incorrectly        
    formatted, or containing invalid values.  All packets are sorted into    
    time order and checked for temporal gaps.  Duplicate packets are also    
    discarded.  Metrics plus any detected anomalies are written to process   
    log files for review by scientists and engineers from the instrument     
    team.  Anomalies noted during the processing are investigated.  Anomalies
    due to missing input files (e.g., instrument science and housekeeping    
    data files, spacecraft housekeeping data files, spacecraft ephemeris     
    kernels, and ancillary files such as leap second and spacecraft clock    
    kernels) are corrected by locating the missing input and reprocessing the
    data.

    Start date for the initial version of the LRO-L-CRAT-2-EDR-RAWDATA-V2.0  
    archival volume is 2009-06-29T00:00:00.000.  This date/time is the begin-
    ning of the first full UTC day following completion of LRO lunar orbit   
    insertion (LOI) maneuvers and transition to the nominal nadir-pointing   
    observation attitude.  It is also the first day for which complete re-   
    constructed ephemeris ('SPK') data was available from the LRO Mission    
    Operations Center.  There is only limited re-constructed ephemeris data  
    currently available for the period between initial instrument power-up   
    (2009-06-20) and LOI completion/transition to the nominal observing      
    attitude.  CRaTER data obtained during Cruise Phase (instrument power-up 
    - 2009-06-23), Lunar Orbit Acquisition (2009-06-23), and the initial     
    Commissioning Period (2009-06-23 - 2009-06-28) will be included when more
    complete ephemeris data becomes available.                               
                                                                             
    Data gaps are identified during initial data processing. Each gap's      
    beginning and end times are recorded in gap files stored in the DOCUMENT 
    directory--there are seperate gap files for primary science, secondary   
    science, and house-keeping data.  Each gap file contains a cumulative    
    listing of the missing data up to and including the time span covered for
    the data current volume.  The minimum duration between successive data   
    packets to qualify as a data gap is specified during data processing.    
                                                                             
    The default gap duration specifications are:                             
    --primary science = 2 seconds;                                           
    --secondary science = 2 seconds;                                         
    --and housekeeping =20 seconds.                                          
                                                                             
    These default gap duration values may be over ridden at the time of data 
    processing.  The gap duration specifications used while processing a     
    specific day's data are recorded in the corresponding process log files  
   and stored in the DATA subdirectoy directory containing the data products.

    The LRO-L-CRAT-2-EDR-RAWDATA-V1.0 data set includes all data obtained    
    by the CRaTER instrument, including data from periods when the instrument
    was placed into special configurations.  Special configurations include  
    the instrument start-up tests that occur whenever the instrument is power
    cycled to (e.g., initial instrument start-up, recovery following space-  
    craft transition to sun-safe mode) as well routine calibrations          
    (90-degree off-nadir GCR background measuerments, internal pulser sweeps,
     LLD zero crossing measurements, and LLD sweeps).                        
                                                                             
    As specified in CRaTER Standard Product Data Record and Archive Volume   
    Software Interface Specification, Document 32-01211, the Level 0 house-  
    keeping data files contain the voltage (V28BUS) and current draw (I28bus)
    measured at the instrument side of the instrument-spacecraft 28 VDC bus  
    interface.  For the LRO CRaTER instrument, the voltage (V28BUS) and cur- 
    rent (I28BUS) values are UNDEFINED.  Immediately prior to instrument     
    delivery, the signal leads from these two monitors were removed to reduce
    excessive EMI emmission; however, the instrument software still processes
    the signals from these open leads and includes them in the housekeeping  
    packets stored in the instrument housekeeping files.  Although no longer 
    defined, these values have been retained in the Level 0 housekeeping     
    files in order to preserve the structure defined for the instrument's    
    housekeeping packets (LRO telemetry ApID = 122).  Although values can be 
    retrieved for the voltage (V28BUS) and current (I28BUS) parameters from  
    the Level 0 housekeeping data files, they are UNDEFINED and should be    
    discarded from any analyses.
