    =================                                                         
      MGS radio occultation experiments were conducted using a 3.6-cm         
      wavelength radio signal transmitted by the spacecraft and received      
      on Earth.  In principle this 'downlink' configuration allows            
      atmospheric structure to be sampled twice per orbit. Occultation        
      entry and exit generally occurred in the northern and southern          
      hemispheres, respectively, and the latitude of the measurements         
      drifted gradually in response to changes in the observing geometry.     
      However, far more experiments were performed at occultation             
      entry than exit, owing to a problem with one of the gimbals used        
      to point the spacecraft high-gain antenna (HGA).  This resulted         
      in particularly dense coverage at latitudes of 60-80 deg in the         
      northern hemisphere. The coverage in longitude of the data set          
      is fairly dense and uniform with few exceptions.                        
                                                                              
      EDS files are stored as ASCII tables, preceded by a header record       
      which contains supplementary information as described below.            
      The headers from each individual file have been collected in a          
      single occultation summary file, which may be useful for scanning       
      the data set, identifying profiles of particular interest, and          
      reviewing the coverage in latitude, season, and solar zenith            
      angle.                                                                  
                                                                              
      David Hinson at Stanford University created all EDS files and the       
      occultation summary file.                                               
                                                                              
      For more information about these data, see [TYLERETAL1992],             
      [HINSONETAL1999], [HINSONETAL2001], and [TYLERETAL2001].                
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Parameters                                                                
    ==========                                                                
      Each EDS file contains a table of electron number density versus        
      radius from Mars' center of mass.  The file also specifies the          
      altitude of each sample relative to the equipotential surface, or       
      areoid, whose mean equatorial radius is 3,396,000 m.  Each profile      
      extends in altitude from about 90 km to 200 km with a sample            
      spacing of about 1 km.  A header record prepended to each table         
      provides information about observing times, experiment geometry,        
      and files used in the data processing.                                  
                                                                              
      The radius of the reference areoid at a given latitude and              
      longitude is computed using a spherical harmonic model of the           
      gravity field, with an additional centrifugal term that arises          
      from the rotation of Mars.  Note that different spherical harmonic      
      models were used in defining the altitude scale for the experiments     
      conducted in 1998 (GGM50A02.SHA) and those conducted in 1999-2006       
      (JGM75C01.SHA).  See [KONOPLIV&SJOGREN1995] for a definition            
      of how the coefficients in these models are normalized.  The            
      spherical harmonic models can be found in PDS data set                  
      MGS-M-RSS-5-SDP-V1.0.                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Processing                                                                
    ==========                                                                
      The MGS radio occultation experiments were optimized for sounding       
      the neutral atmosphere, but electron density profiles were also         
      obtained from a limited subset of observations.  The retrieval          
      algorithm involves no a priori assumptions about the shape of           
      the electron density profile, the peak density, or the altitude         
      of the peak, but the electron density is assumed to be zero at          
      altitudes below about 90 km and above about 250 km.  The typical        
      uncertainty in the MGS electron density profiles is several             
      thousand per cubic centimeter.  At this level of sensitivity,           
      reliable profiles could be obtained over an altitude range of           
      about 90-200 km for experiments in which the solar zenith angle         
      was less than about 90 degrees.                                         
                                                                              
      Electron density profiles are derived from raw receiver output          
      in several steps.                                                       
                                                                              
      First, deterministic sources of frequency change are identified         
      and removed coherently. These included motion of the spacecraft,        
      motion of the Earth receiving station, drift of the UltraStable         
      Oscillator (USO), and relativistic effects associated with              
      gravity fields of solar system bodies.  This leaves the carrier         
      signal at a known frequency except for phase drift associated           
      with passage of the radio ray through Mars' atmosphere and/or           
      ionosphere.  Drift associated with passage through solar plasma         
      or the Earth's atmosphere or ionosphere is assumed to be                
      negligible over the time of a Mars occultation (approximately           
      two minutes).                                                           
                                                                              
      Second, using an accurate reconstruction of the spacecraft              
      trajectory, the phase of the signal versus time is converted            
      into a measure of refraction angle versus impact parameter --           
      the perpendicular distance between the incoming raypath and the         
      center of curvature of the atmosphere.                                  
                                                                              
      Third, the index of refraction versus radius is obtained using          
      an Abel inversion [FJELDBOETAL1971].  At ionospheric heights, the       
      refractive index is determined predominantly by free electrons,         
      and there is a simple linear relationship between refractive            
      index and electron number density.  An electron density profile         
      is obtained by applying this linear transformation to the               
      refractive index profile, using coefficients that depend on the         
      measurement frequency (8423 MHz).                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Data                                                                      
    ====                                                                      

      The following description of the data is based on the original,
      CD-WO form of the archive.  The current form of the archive
      is an electronic archive volume containing all the data from
      the original CD-WO.  In the current archive, the data are
      organized into subdirectories of the DATA directory,
      according to data type and (when possible) year and month of
      the data.  The descriptions of the meanings and names of the
      various data types remain the same as those given in this file.

      Data are stored on a single volume in the EDS directory                 
      in subdirectories in the order they were collected.  Twelve             
      subdirectories have been defined with names of the form                 
      yyyy_ddd  where  yyyy  is the year and  ddd  is the day-of-year         
      of the first profile in each directory.  Directory boundaries           
      have been chosen so that collections have common characteristics,       
      such as similar Ls values, or are easily separated by periods           
      when there was little MGS RST activity, such as solar conjunction       
      or spacecraft anomalies when no data were collected.  When these        
      criteria allowed more than 1000 profiles in a directory,                
      arbitrary boundaries were added.  The largest directory                 
      contains only 877 profiles.  The directories and their                  
      boundaries are summarized below.                                        
                                                                              
      Electron density profiles are stored with file names of                 
      the form  ydddhmmC.EDS  where  y  is the least significant              
      digit of the year,  ddd  is the three-digit day number,                 
      h  is a one-character string denoting the hour, and  mm  is             
      a two-character string denoting the minute in which data                
      acquisition began.  h  is  'A' if the hour was  00,  'B'                
      if the hour was  01, ... and 'X' if the hour was 23.  In                
      most cases  mm  is the two-digit minute; but when data were             
      collected from two sources and the start time was in the                
      same minute, the second digit in  mm  was changed to a                  
      letter in the second file name (minute  00  becomes  0A,  01

      This archival data set was reviewed by the MGS Radio Science            
      Team prior to submission to the Planetary Data System (PDS).            
                                                                              
      All of the profiles had been in the public domain as elements           
      of the MGS-M-RSS-5-SDP-V1.0 data set for as much as seven years         
      before this reorganized data set was compiled.                          

      When the unified archive was created from the CD-WO volumes,
      many of the descriptive textual files were changed.  However,
      their contents are essentially the same as in the original,
      reviewed files.

      This section describes the data in the original CD-WO
      archive.  The same data are preserved in the present
      form of the archive, but the directory structure has
      changed considerably.   

      The following table describes the directories that contain              
      the profiles.  Each directory is represented by one row.  The           
      first two columns list the year and day-of-year of the first            
      and last profiles in each directory, respectively.  The first           
      column is also the directory name.  The third and fourth                
      columns provide the same information in standard calendar               
      format.  The fifth and sixth columns give the number of the             
      Martian year (MY, as defined by [CLANCYETAL2000]) and the               
      approximate areocentric longitude of the Sun (Ls, in degrees)           
      of the first and last profiles in each directory, respectively.         
      The last column specifies the number of profiles in each                
      directory.  Blank rows denote major gaps between measurements           
      in different Martian years.

      MGS radio occultation experiments were capable of sounding              
      the lower neutral atmosphere under a wide range of conditions,          
      but reliable electron density profiles could be obtained only           
      when the solar zenith angle was less than about 90 degrees              
      at the location of the measurement.  For this reason the MGS            
      mission produced far fewer electron density profiles (5600)             
      than profiles of the neutral atmosphere (21243).                        
                                                                              
      Coverage of the ionosphere was limited by other factors.                
      This is particularly true during the pre-mapping phases of              
      the mission, which extended into early 1999.  Prior to the              
      start of the mapping phase, the spacecraft frequently                   
      conducted special maneuvers for aerobraking and temperature             
      control, and scientific observations were constrained by                
      numerous other operational issues.  The following discussion            
      summarizes the most significant gaps in coverage that occurred          
      during the mapping phase of the mission.                                
                                                                              
      Low Solar Zenith Angles                                                 
      -----------------------                                                 
        Because the orbit of Mars is outside the orbit of Earth,              
        occultations tend to take place near the terminator.                  
        Scientists interested in studying convection in the                   
        neutral atmosphere or peak electron densities in the                  
        ionosphere will find relatively few observations near                 
        local noon except where the occultation point is at polar             
        latitudes.

      ------------------                                                      
        The noise level of the radio occultation measurements                 
        increased dramatically near solar conjunction.  This                  
        prevented retrieval of profiles in the following intervals:           
        2000_153 - 2000_213

        2004_204 - 2004_283                                                   
        2006_263 - 2006_277                                                   
                                                                              
      Beta Supplement                                                         
      ----------------                                                        
        The range of motion of one of the gimbals that controls               
        pointing of the spacecraft HGA was severely restricted                
        until late in the mission, when the obstruction vanished              
        for reasons unknown. During the extended intervals when               
        the failed gimbal prevented normal operations, the                    
        spacecraft was configured in a 'beta supplement' mode                 
        that restored most of its functionality. This had no                  
        effect on measurements at occultation entry (northern                 
        hemisphere) but experiments could not be conducted                    
        routinely at occultation exit (southern hemisphere) when              
        the spacecraft was in the beta supplement mode:

      Spacecraft Anomalies and Emergencies                                    
      --------------------------------------                                  
        The spacecraft occasionally stopped collecting scientific             
        data for periods of several days in response to problems              
        with flight software or hardware.  This prevented                     
        occultation experiments from being conducted in the                   
        following intervals:                                                  
        2001_123 - 2001_129                                                   
        2002_059 - 2002_065                                                   
        2002_092 - 2002_100                                                   
        2003_162 - 2003_168                                                   
        2004_358 - 2004_360                                                   
        2005_239 - 2005_251                                                   
        2005_256 - 2005_261                                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Data Quality                                                              
    =============                                                             
                                                                              
      Each profile includes uncertainties on the estimates of                 
      electron number density.  This is the best source of                    
      information about data quality.  Some obvious trends are                
      apparent in the error bars, such as a general increase                  
      in the noise level when the spacecraft was close to solar               
      conjunction.  Data quality can vary significantly between               
      successive experiments, and sometimes from one DSN complex              
      to another, and these variations are reflected in the                   
      error bars.                                                             
                                                                              
      Some error sources are difficult to quantify, and their                 
      effects are therefore not included in the formal                        
      uncertainties. As a general rule, diametric occultations                
      yield more reliable results than grazing occultations.                  
      (The header of each profile includes several parameters,                
      such as the 'angle from diametric', that characterize                   
      the experiment geometry.)                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Limitations                                                               
    ===========
