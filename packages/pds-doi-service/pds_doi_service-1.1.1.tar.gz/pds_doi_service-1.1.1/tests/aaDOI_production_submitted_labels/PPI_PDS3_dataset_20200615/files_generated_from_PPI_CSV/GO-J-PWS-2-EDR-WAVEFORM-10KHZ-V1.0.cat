    or 3,150/s taken through bandpass filters of 80, 10, or 1 kHz,            
    respectively.  Each sample is a 4-bit measurement after an automatic      
    gain control (AGC) amplifier designed to keep the signal amplitude        
    in a range commensurate with the optimal analog-to-digital converter      
    dynamic range with a time constant of about 500 msec.  As such, the       
    measurements are not absolutely calibrated, although it is possible       
    to determine the approximate AGC gain from a digital performance          
    parameter available every 2.667 seconds, assuming the signal              
    amplitude does not vary appreciably over the 2.667 second interval.       
    Alternately, the sweep frequency receiver (low rate) portion of the       
    instrument can be used to determine the absolute amplitude of waves.      
    In many cases, the waveform data are used without any calibration         
    for the purposes of identifying characteristic frequencies of the         
    plasma via resonances or cutoffs, observing discrete emissions such       
    as chorus or whistlers, or looking at the detailed form of the            
    waveforms.                                                                
                                                                              
    In general, the waveform samples are not continuous over long time        
    periods due to the limited telemetry capability of the Galileo data       
    system and limits on the bandwidth available to the PWS instrument.       
    Instead, sequences of contiguous samples are collected for up to          
    about 67 msec followed by a gap.  The number of consecutive samples       
    between gaps is determined by the telemetry format and the bandwidth      
    (instrument mode).  Details of the timing, number of consecutive          
    samples in a series, and the effective duty cycle are described in        
    the inst.cat, rowpfx.fmt, and edrhdr.fmt files included with the          
    data set.                                                                 
                                                                              
    The data are formatted in files covering no more than 1 RIM (60.667       
    s) each up to 91 data records, with a record containing 10 or 80          
    blocks of contiguous waveform samples.  The data in any one file are      
    from only a single combination of instrument mode (waveform) and          
    telemetry format, however, the antenna can change within a file;          
    this is noted in the record header information, but is only updated       
    every 2.667 sec, hence, may not be accurate less than 2.667 seconds       
    after a real antenna change. Since the instrument mode information        
    is also updated only once per 2.667 seconds, the last data in a           
    record (less than 2.667 seconds) may actually be in a different           
    mode.                                                                     
                                                                              
    The typical uses of the waveform data are to (1) display the              
    waveform of plasma wave and other signals such as dust impacts, and       
    (2) as highly detailed (in time and frequency) spectra through the        
    use of Fourier transforms.  To avoid artifacts, we suggest not            
    transforming over the gaps but limiting the input to the Fourier          
    transform to a single contiguous series of samples.  Spectra from         
    individual waveform series can be stacked in order to generate            
    frequency-time dynamic spectrograms.                                      
                                                                              
    This data set is highly discontinuous in time. Because of the severe      
    limitations in the downlink capability of the Galileo spacecraft,         
    LPW rate data were recorded only for targeted observations. Most          
    of these data were acquired near the Galilean moons, although             
    selected observations were made in various locations around the           
    magnetosphere. Table 1 below provides a listing of the start and          
    stop times of the recorded data segments. Even within these time.         
    intervals, the data are discontinuous. Data are acquired by using         
    both the electric field and magnetic field antennas. The PDS labels       
    provided contain information about which antenna was used to              
    to generate the data in each file. All 10 kHz observations were           
    recorded in the LPW tape format with the instrument configured            
    into the PWH5 data format.
