    --------------------                                                     
      This data set contains derived values of the electron density          
      and moment temperature at Jupiter during the Voyager 1                 
      encounter in the PLS voltage range (10-5950 eV/q).  Adjacent           
      low and high energy electron measurements are combined to              
      form a composite spectra which is used for the moment                  
      calculation.  The moment calculations are performed as                 
      described in [SCUDDERETAL1981].  These assume isotropic                
      distributions and correct for positive spacecraft charge when          
      applicable and interpolate electron spectra below the 10 eV            
      instrument threshold before performing the integration over            
      velocity.  On day 64 from 415-1830 negative charging of the            
      spacecraft renders electron moment densities unreliable.               
      Therefore, the PLS ion densities were used to derive electron          
      densities from 0415-1400 assuming charge neutrality and from           
      1830-1940 using a model based on inbound plasma parameters.            
      PRA densities were used to derive electron densities from              
      1400 to 1830.  Electron temperatures derived from PLS                  
      electron data are used except inside L=5.4, where T[E] was             
      set equal to T[I] and should be considered an upper limit.             
      The data used from 415-1830 on day 64 are described in                 
      [SITTLER&STROBEL1987].  Data format: column 1 is time                  
      (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2 is the moment density in          
      cm^-3, column 3 the temperature in eV.  Each row has format            
      (a24, 2(1x,1pe9.2)).  Values of -9.99e+10 indicate that the            
      parameter could not be obtained from the data using the                
      standard analysis technique.  Additional information about             
      this data set and the instrument which produced it can be              
      found elsewhere in this catalog.  An overview of the data in           
      this data set can be found in [SCUDDERETAL1981] and

    A derived parameter equaling the number of electrons per unit            
    volume over a specified range of electron energy.  Different             
    forms of electron density are distinguished by method of                 
    derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of moments) or by some                
    selection criteria (ie., hot electron and cold electron                  
    density).  In general, if more than one electron component is            
    analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density will be               
    provided which is the sum of the electron densities.  If the             
    electrons do not have a Maxwellian distribution the actual               
    distribution can be represented as the sum of several                    
    Maxwellians, in which case the density of each Maxwellian is             
    given.

    A derived parameter giving an indication of the mean                     
    energy/electron, assuming the shape of the electron energy               
    derived spectrum to be Maxwellian.  Given that the electron              
    energy spectrum is not exactly Maxwellian, the electron                  
    temperature can be defined integrally (whereby the mean energy           
    obtained by integrating under the actual electron energy                 
    spectrum is set equal to the integral under a Maxwellian, where          
    the temperature is a free parameter for which to solve), or              
    differentially (whereby the slopes of the actually electron              
    energy spectrum at various energies are matched to the slopes            
    of a corresponding Maxwellian).                                          
                                                                             
    The temperature parameter is often qualified with a range of             
    applicable energies.  Temperatures can be angularly                      
    anisotropic.  If the electrons do not have a Maxwellian                  
    distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the           
    sum of several Maxwellians, each with a separate temperature.

  =========================                                                  
    This data set provides the best estimate available of the total          
    electron density in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV).  Four             
    assumptions were made 1) secondary electrons escaping from the           
    collector plate of the detector were neglected; 2)                       
    extrapolations were made to estimate the number of electrons             
    outside the PLS energy range; 3) electrons were assumed to have          
    isotropic distributions; 4) where the spacecraft potential was           
    small the shape of the thermal electron spectra was used to              
    estimate the charge and correct the derived densities.  1)               
    Should result in an underestimate of the electron density by no          
    more than 10% for electron temperature (T[E]) &#10094; 100 eV and no            
    more than 30% for T[E] &#10095; 100 eV.  2) Gives uncertainties of at           
    most 10%, and usually much smaller, for T[E] = 5-3000 eV which           
    is the T[E] range measured in this region.  3) Should be an              
    excellent assumption since isotropization times for electrons            
    are fast, and since the electron thermal speed is always much            
    greater than the plasma flow speed.  4) In regions where the             
    spacecraft charge is positive (outside 10 R[J]) charging                 
    produces uncertainties of at most 10%.  inside of ~10 R[J] the           
    spacecraft potential is negative and electron densities are not          
    reliable.  From 0415 to 1940 on March 5 the ion charge density           
    was used to estimate the electron density using the condition            
    of charge neutrality.  Uncertainties for the ion charge density          
    in this region are less than 10%.  From 1400-1830 electron               
    densities derived from PRA densities are used; these have                
    uncertainties of at most 20%.  From 1830-1940 no direct                  
    measurement of electron density is available and 'predict                
    densities' based on inbound ion measurements and a model of the          
    plasma distribution are used.  T[E] in all regions except                
    between 1000 and 1350 is calculated from the PLS electron data           
    and has uncertainties approximately equal to the density                 
    uncertainties.  Between 1000 and 1350 T[E] is so far below the           
    instrument threshold of 10 eV that no signal is seen; in this            
    region te is set equal to the ion temperature observed at the            
    same L shell and should be considered an upper limit.
