            A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit          
            volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,       
            or energy/nucleon.  Discrimination with regard to mass and or     
            charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,       
            mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument         
            limitations.                                                      
                                                                              
            Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are        
            distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or     
            their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of             
            moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will      
            be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than       
            one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total     
            density will be provided which is the sum of the ion              
            densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian      
            distribution the actual distribution can be represented as        
            the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of      
            each Maxwellian is given.

   ===================                                                        
                                                                              
          THIS DATA SET PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE POSITIVE ION CHARGE       
          DENSITY.  SEVERAL ASSUMPTION/SIMPLIFICATIONS ARE MADE TO            
          SIMPLIFY THE ANALYSIS WHICH MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OF THE          
          RESULTS.  HIGH MACH NUMBER FLOW IS ASSUMED; MACH NUMBERS OF 1,      
          WHICH ARE OBSERVED IN THE INNER MAGNETOSPHERE, CAN RESULT IN        
          50% UNDERESTIMATES OF THE CHARGE DENSITY.  THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES     
          A UNIT RESPONSE (IE., ALL PARTICLES IN A COLD BEAM INCIDENT ON      
          THE APERTURE OF THE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AT THE             
          COLLECTOR).  THE ACTUAL RESPONSE IS AS LOW AS 70%.  A VELOCITY      
          INTO THE DETECTOR MUST ALSO BE ASSUMED; THE VELOCITY USED IS        
          THE COROTATION VELOCITY.  OBSERVATIONS INDICATE THAT IN SOME        
          REGIONS THE ACTUAL VELOCITY IS AS LITTLE AS HALF OF THE             
          COROTATION VELOCITY, GIVING FACTOR OF 2 ERRORS IN THE DENSITY.      
          FINALLY, ONLY IONS IN THE PLS ENERGY RANGE (10-5950 EV/Q) ARE       
          COUNTED.  THE CUMULATIVE ERROR FROM ALL THESE EFFECTS IS LESS       
          THAN 10% IN THE SOLAR WIND, LESS THAN 30% IN THE OUTER              
          MAGNETOSPHERE (R&#10095;10 RS), AND UP TO A FACTOR OF 3 INSIDE THIS.       
          SINCE THE AMPLITUDE OF EACH OF THESE EFFECTS VARIES SLOWLY IN       
          TIME (DISTANCE), THE RELATIVE CHANGES IN DENSITY ARE GOOD TO 10     
          PERCENT IN MOST CASES.  THIS DATA SET IS MOST USEFUL FOR            
          LOOKING AT DENSITY VARIATIONS; ION FIT DENSITIES ARE MUCH           
          BETTER INDICATORS OF THE ABSOLUTE PLASMA DENSITY
