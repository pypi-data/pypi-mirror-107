      Data Set Overview
      =================
      The Juno Waves EDR complete data set includes all Waves science and 
      housekeeping data for the entire Juno mission.  This data set consists
      of reformatted, uncalibrated, spectra and waveforms as well as unaltered
      housekeeping packets.  The reformatting operation re-assembles 
      measurements which were too long to fit with in a single transmission
      unit to the Juno flight data system as well as decompressing data that
      were transmitted in compressed form.  The data for this set were
      acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR), High Frequency
      Receivers (HFR-44, HFR-45), as well as the Digital Signal Processor's
      housekeeping output.  This data set is intended to preserve the
      uncalibrated instrument packets and is to be used only as a last resort.
      Other Waves archived data sets are designed to be complete and more
      easily used.  Browse images associated with the other data sets provide
      a graphical search of the data included in this data set.

      The primary usefulness of these data lay in preserving the inputs to
      higher level calibrated data sets so that such sets may be regenerated
      in the event that better calibrations become available or in the event
      that mistakes are uncovered in the data processing pipelines.  In either
      event the Waves instrument team is intended as the user of these data,
      *not* the wider scientific community.


      Parameters
      ==========
      The fundamental unit of this data set is a Waves packet.  In the case
      of science packets, each packet contains a single measurement along with
      information required to calibrate the measurement and determine when it
      was collected.  Actually producing calibrated data from these raw
      packets requires detailed knowledge of the Waves instrument.
      Housekeeping packets are also included as these contain fine timing
      information.


      Processing
      ==========
      The data included in this data set were processed by the EDR
      processing pipeline as described in section 3.3 of the VOLSIS document
      found under the DOCUMENTS sub-directory.  In short, this pipeline
      consists of programs which reassemble fragmented packets, decompress
      packets and check for CRC errors.


      Data
      ====
      Products in this data set are simply described as PDS FILE objects with
      minimal detached labels as no more specific PDS objects exist to define
      a file consisting of variable length packets.  Appendix C of the VOLSIS
      outlines the data format of these raw packets and the WAVES_PACKETS 
      document, contained in the DOCUMENT directory, provides detailed
      information.


      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      This data set is complete, though the generation of higher level
      calibrated data from this raw data set requires the following additional
      information:

         1. Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility's SPICE toolkit
            and Juno mission SPICE kernels.

         2. Calibration tables supplied on this volume by the Waves
            instrument team


      Coordinate Systems
      ==================
      As these are raw data they are recorded in the frame of the electric
      and magnetic sensors and are not rotated into any other coordinate
      system.  The WAVES_INST.CAT catalog file, located in this directory,
      contains a description of the detectors' orientation with respect to
      the Juno spacecraft coordinate frame.


      Software
      ========
      No software is provided to view, interpret, or convert this data set.
      
      
      Media/Format
      ============
      This data set is provided to the Planetary Data System electronically
      as part of a volume level 'tarball' file, though the standards for file
      names, directory names and path lengths follow the guidelines provided
      in the 'Planetary Data System Standards Reference', version 3.8, under
      section 10.1.3, 'Specification for Files Delivered Electronically'.

      The 'tarball' file contains all files for a release of this volume in a
      single GNU Tar file that has then been compressed via the GNU gzip
      utility.  The tar file preserves the relative directory path for each
      file so when unpacked the original volume directory structure is
      recreated.  See Section 4 of the VOLSIS for more details on the data
      transfer methods."
      


    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE   = "
        
      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      This data set contains all instrument packets for the Juno Waves
      experiment for the interval described in the labels for the 
      individual product files.  Every effort has been made to ensure that
      all data returned to the Juno Science Operations Center from the
      spacecraft are included, even those packets which fail checksum tests.  

      
      Review
      ======
      The Waves raw complete data will be reviewed internally by the Juno
      Waves instrument team prior to release to the PDS.  The data set will
      also be reviewed by the PDS.
      

      Data Coverage and Quality
      =========================
      TBD

      
      Limitations
      ===========
      Limitations on the data set may be defined as the Waves team gains
      experience operating the instrument in flight conditions.  The only
      known a priori limitation is that some packets may become corrupted
      during transmission over the space link.  Each packet contains a CRC
      generated within the instrument prior to transmission to the Juno flight
      data system.  Packets with CRC failures are retained in this raw data
      set but should not be used to generate higher level products."
