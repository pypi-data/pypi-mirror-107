Dataset Overview                                                             
                                                                             
This dataset contains full resolution magnetometer data from the Pioneer     
Venus Orbiter spacecraft beginning with orbit 3602 (Oct 16, 1988) and        
continuing until the orbiter was lost in the Venusian atmosphere (orbit      
5055, Oct 7, 1992). The dataset differs from the high resolution magnetometer
dataset from theprevious orbits due to an anomaly in the multiplexor that    
controlled the sampling of the magnetometer sensors. During orbit 3602, and  
for the remainder of the mission, the spacecraft downlink contained          
magnetometer data from only the P sensor. The P sensor is the sensor which   
is aligned with the spacecraft spin axis, nominally in the direction of the  
ecliptic normal.                                                             
                                                                             
After the anomaly was first detected, the magnetometer team made a           
substantial effort to recover the average magnetic field vector using the    
single sensor data. Since the sensor is not perfectly aligned with the       
spacecraft spin axis, a small amount of spin modulation is present in the    
sensor data. In theory, the amplitude of the spin plane field can be         
determined from the amplitude of the spin modulation and knowledge of the    
true sensor mounting geometry. In practice, this turned out to be a very     
difficult task because the spin axis of the spacecraft is not sufficiently   
constant in body-fixed coordinates.                                          
                                                                             
                                                                             
Data Processing                                                              
                                                                             
This dataset has been calibrated to account for sensor zero levels, gains,   
and geometry. The data are given in units of nanoTesla. The data are at the  
full downlink sampling resolution. They have not been resampled during the   
data processing procedure. After the anomaly, the onboard calibrate signal   
continued to function and the calibration of the instrument was repeatedly   
checked. No change in gain was detected. The technique used to check the zero
levels earlier in the mission could not be used after the anomaly occurred.  
Since the operations were limited to the low power available on the          
spacecraft, and since the magnetometer became a low priority instrument, it  
was not possible to check the zero levels to the levels desirable. However,  
it is clear that towards the end of the mission the zero levels had drifted  
significantly. It is recommended that these data be used principally in a    
variometer mode, i.e. for changes only.

The data 'P' columns are values which have been sampled from the P           
sensor directly. The magnetometer samples each sensor 38 microseconds after  
the previous sensor sample. The data processing procedure uses the P1 sample 
to determine the Bz value and hence it is sampled at the start of sweep      
(time-tag) time.

  Other datasets on the CD-ROM are the Ephemeris which contains spacecraft   
position in Venus Solar Orbital coordinates, spacecraft altitude, solar      
zenith angle, Venus centered longitude and latitude, spacecraft spin axis    
components, celestial longitude and latitude of the spacecraft, celestial    
longitude of the earth, and the Sun-spacecraft range.                        
  Other ancillary datasets are the: 1) phase and offset which contains the   
phase amplitude of sun synchronous modulation of the 4 signals (E100, E730,  
E5.4 and E30K), and offsets of the G sensor. 2) The engineering dataset which
contains temperatures, magnetometer modes, magnetometer sample format,       
magnetometer spin average select, telemetry data format, telemetry bit rate, 
spacecraft spin period, pulse time, the difference between the Sun pulse time
and the Rip pulse time, and the pulse time flag.
