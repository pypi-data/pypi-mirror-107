      =================                                                       
      This data set contains magnetic-field data acquired during the          
      cruise and tour phases of the Cassini mission to Saturn.                
      On 16 August, 1999 two days before the spacecraft commenced Earth       
      swingby, the magnetometer boom was unfurled into its extended           
      position; a  configuration it maintained for the remainder of the       
      mission.  Magnetic-field data acquired prior to boom deployment are     
      limited and are significantly affected by spacecraft noise. These       
      data are of no scientific value and, consequently, do not form part     
      of this data set.                                                       
                                                                              
      Cassini carried two magnetometers: a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)        
      and a vector-helium magnetometer capable of operating in both           
      vector and scalar mode (V/SHM). This data set contains calibrated,      
      and averaged magnetic-field data recorded by the FGM instrument.        
      The data are provided in 1 minute averages.  The 1 minute data are      
      provided in year files. The data are provided in RTN coordinates        
      throughout the mission. After arrival at Saturn, the Saturn-centered    
      KRTP, KSO, and KSM coordinates are also provided. Earth-centered,       
      and Jupiter-centered coordinates are provided for the flybys of         
      those two planets. All data files are ASCII.                            
                                                                              
      These data were calibrated, and rotated into geophysical coordinates    
      by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial College (IC), and provided to       
      the PDS/PPI node via the Cassini MAG team Co-I at UCLA. In other        
      words these data use the same calibration as the data routinely         
      delivered to the Cassini MAG team. The data were also averaged at       
      IC. The data were reformatted into their current ASCII format,          
      add trajectory information was added at PDS/PPI.

         RTN coordinates consist of R (radial component, Sun to the           
         spacecraft), T (tangential component, parallel to the Solar          
         Equatorial plane and perpendicular to R), and N (normal component,

         KRTP magnetic field vector components form the standard right-handed 
         spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a planet-centered system.        
         Namely, R is radial (along the line from the center of Saturn to the 
         center of the spacecraft), and positive away from Saturn. Phi, the   
         azimuthal component, is parallel to the Kronographic equator (Omega  
         x R) and positive in the direction of corotation. Theta, the         
         'southward' component, completes the right-handed set.

      coordinates, and generating the associated trajectory information.      
      Copies of these metakernels are included in the GEOMETRY directory of

      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 1 data were calibrated at the PDS/PPI node at        
      UCLA using software (CAL02), and calibration data provided by the       
      Cassini MAG team. The process used the same calibration data that       
      was provided with the Raw Magnetometer data archive (Data Set ID:       
      CO-E/SW/J/S-MAG-2-REDR-RAW-DATA-V1.0). The data were then rotated       
      into geophysical coordinates using MAG team additonal MAG team          
      provided code (TRANSCAL) and spice kernels obtained from NAIF.          
      Additional processing, including averaging, reformatting to ASCII,      
      and the addition of trajectory to the 1 minute data was performed       
      using code developed at PDS/PPI.                                        
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 2 data were calibrated, and rotated into             
      geophysical coordinates by the Cassini MAG team at Imperial             
      College, and provided to the PDS/PPI node via the MAG team Co-I at      
      UCLA. The 1 minute data were also averaged at IC. Averaging for the     
      1 second data was performed at PDS/PPI. The data were reformatted       
      at PDS/PPI to match the format used for the version 1 data.             
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 3 data were processed following the same             
      procedure that was followed for the version 2 data. However,            
      subsequent to the release of the version 2 data it was discovered       
      that the coordinate system trasformation for some of those data had     
      been performed using predict SPICE kernels, rather than                 
      reconstructions. The version 3 were reprocessed using reconstructed     
      ephemeris kernels for all of the data.                                  
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 4 data were processed following the same             
      procedure that was followed for the version 2 and 3 data. These         
      data, however, were processed using only reconstructed SPK's to         
      generate the trajectory data, thus correcting the errors which          
      were present in the version 3 data. The MAG data do not differ          
      between versions 3 and 4.                                               
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 5 data were processed following the same             
      procedure that was followed for the version 3 and 4 data.  These data   
      include corrections to the NPTS column data values, and some updates to 
      the label files.                                                        
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 6 for RTN data files - The DATA/ *_FGM_RTN_1M.TAB    
      files, Version 5, and older versions, had assigned a width to the Sun   
      to Spacecraft distance column (RANGE) that was insufficient to          
      accommodate values over 10 AU. This resulted in inconsistent  record    
      structures and lengths. The version 6 RTN files correct this error by   
      allocating an additional byte to the RANGE column width and adjusting   
      the start position of the subsequent columns accordingly.               
                                                                              
      PRODUCT_VERSION_ID 6 for KRTP, KSO, and KSM and PRODUCT_VERSION_ID for  
      RTN data files were processed using an updated calibration that was     
      produced using data from the Cassini Proximal Orbits.
