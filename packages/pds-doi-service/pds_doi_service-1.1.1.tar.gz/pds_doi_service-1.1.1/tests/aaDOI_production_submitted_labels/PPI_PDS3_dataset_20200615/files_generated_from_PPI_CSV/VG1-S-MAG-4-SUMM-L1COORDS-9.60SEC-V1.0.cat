    The full LFM instrument sample rate is 1 sample per 0.06 seconds.         
    Full telemetry resolution 'detail' data must be obtained from the         
    instrument team. For this data set, the data have been resampled to       
    9.6 seconds from 1.92 second summary data. The 1.92 second data were      
    in turn resampled from the detail data.

    magnetic field magnitude and fluctuations. Instrument digitization        
    uncertainty depends upon dynamic range as indicated in the following

    Voyager EDR's undergo the following processing in order to produce

    Counts are measured onboard using 12 bit words that may represent         
    values ranging from 0-4096. Integer counts are converted to magnetic      
    field units (gammas) by subtracting a zero offset, from the measured      
    MAG value and multiplying this difference by the sensitivity of the       
    instrument.
