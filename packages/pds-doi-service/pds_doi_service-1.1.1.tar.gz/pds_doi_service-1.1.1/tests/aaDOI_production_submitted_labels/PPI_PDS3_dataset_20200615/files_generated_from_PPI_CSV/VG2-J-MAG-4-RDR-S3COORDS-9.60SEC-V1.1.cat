      This data set contains some data gaps and spikes. The data set          
      does contain a flag value which has been provided by the PI             
      (Norman Ness) that indicates whether or not a particular                
      record has been contaminated by software error or by                    
      spacecraft interference (a flag value of 1 indicates a bad              
      value, 0 indicates that the record has either not been                  
      evaluated or is good). Some records that are obviously                  
      contaminated have not been flagged. The hourly summary data             
      will show a contamination code and data quality code of 2 when          
      data in the hour have not been flagged but are obviously in             
      error and a contamination code of 1 when the hour contains              
      flagged records."
