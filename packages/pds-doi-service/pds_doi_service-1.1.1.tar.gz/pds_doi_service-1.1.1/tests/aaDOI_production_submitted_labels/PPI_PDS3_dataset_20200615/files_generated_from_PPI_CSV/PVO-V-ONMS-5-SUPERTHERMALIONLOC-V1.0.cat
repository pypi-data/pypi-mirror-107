    This dataset contains start and stop times/locations where               
superthermal ions were detected by the Neutral Mass Spectrometer             
instrument aboard the Pioneer Venus Orbiter. The instrument detected         
superthermal, energetic or fast ions whose energy exceeds 36 eV in           
the spacecraft frame of reference.  These ions were observed in              
early orbits during measurements of the neutral density near                 
periapsis, have an erratic and unpredictable signature, and occur            
at too high an altitude to be due to the neutral atmosphere. When the        
altitude of periapsis increased above the point where neutral density        
measurements could be made, the instrument was configured                    
specifically to detect superthermal ions.  In general, for orbit             
numbers 1 to 645, data were taken from the RPA mode.  The gas                
background signal with the filament on is about a factor of 10               
less in this mode than in non-RPA mode, resulting in a lower                 
detection threshold. For orbit numbers above 923, the instrument             
was deliberately configured with the filament off and non-RPA                
mode data was used. For mass 16 the RPA voltage is about +3.8                
volts."

    The data reduction process has been described in Kasprzak                
et al. (1987). The method used to reduce the data assumes                    
cylindrical symmetry of the ion source.  In actual fact, the                 
source is asymmetrical in its angular response (Guenther, 1989).             
This can introduce as much as a factor of 2 scatter in the data.             
No simple solution has been found for modeling this asymmetry                
since the actual ion drift vector is unknown. The minimum energy             
of an ion detectable by the ONMS in this ion mode is 35.9 eV.                
The maximum transmission is assumed to occur about 10 V above                
this value.  On the nightside of Venus the spacecraft potential              
is negative and the most probable ion energy is near 40 eV.                  
                                                                             
The ion species regularly monitored include: He+, N+, O+,                    
N+ and/or CO+ and CO2+. Because of the paucity of data at other              
mass numbers only mass 16 (atomic oxygen) has been reduced to a              
flux and number density. As part of the reduction process the                
angle in the ecliptic plane of the apparent ion flow in spacecraft           
reference frame has been deduced. The flux values are estimated              
in the spacecraft reference frame relative to spacecraft ground.             
The density is computed from the flux by dividing it by a speed              
corresponding to 40 eV. No correction has been applied to the                
angle, density or flux in order to remove the effect of spacecraft           
velocity.

       In order to fit the data, a minimum of 30 points were required        
    in 36 seconds. In addition, the maximum to minimum count ratio was       
    required to be factor of 3 or greater in order to insure that there      
    was a definitive spin modulation.  The center 12 seconds of data is      
    divided by the fitting function to derive the equivalent flux for        
    that point. The center of the new fitting interval is adjusted so        
    that it is centered on the expected signal maximum predicted from        
    the previous interval fit. As a result of this method of fitting,        
    discontinuities may exist near minimum angle of attack where one         
    12 second interval adjoins the next interval.
