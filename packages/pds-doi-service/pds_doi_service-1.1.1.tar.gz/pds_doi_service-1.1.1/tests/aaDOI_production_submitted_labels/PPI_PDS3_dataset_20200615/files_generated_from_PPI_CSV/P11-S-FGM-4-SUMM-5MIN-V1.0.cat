      This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded by       
      the Fluxgate Magnetometer on board the Pioneer 11 spacecraft,          
      during the Saturn encounter period.  Data include 5 minute             
      averages of the magnetic field in RK spherical coordinates             
      and spacecraft trajectory in Kronographic (L1) coordinates.            
                                                                             
                                                                             
      Data Sampling

      At Saturn, instantaneous vector measurements were obtained             
      every 146.3 second, in synchronism with the spacecraft spin            
      period of 7.7 second.

      The time resolution for this data set is described as 5 minute         
      in the NSSDC documentation.  However, data point spacing in the        
      file is variable and found mostly about 7 minute.

      Kronographic (L1) coordinates is a Saturn centered spherical           
      system, based on the Saturn Longitude System (Voyager Measurements     
      of the Rotation Period of Saturn's Magnetic Field, Desch and Kaiser,   
      JGR, 8, 253, 1981).                                                    
                                                                             
      RK coordinates is based on two principle directions, Saturn to         
      Pioneer 11, R, and Saturn spin axis, J.  X=R points away from          
      Saturn.  Y is a vector in the direction of J cross R.  Z is X          
      cross Y.  Radial direction R, points away from Saturn, polar           
      direction THETA, positive northward, and azimuthal direction,          
      PSI, parallel to the X-Y plane, positive eastward.

      There is no ancillary data associated with this data set.

      ======================                                                 
      The fluxgate magnetometer was calibrated at the GSFC Magnetic          
      Test Facility by means of a 2 meter diameter, single axis              
      Helmholtz coil system.  Typically hysteresis observed after            
      exposure to 2.5 mT fields was less than 1 part in 10**3 (one           
      count).  Temperature stability is better than +- 0.5% over the         
      temperature range of -20 to +40 degree Celsius in spite of the         
      open loop design of the instrument.  This is due to the fact           
      that the characteristics of the magnetic material used in the          
      sensor cores are fairly independent of temperature over the            
      indicated range.  The stability figure includes the A/D converter      
      drift and a large portion of it is due to the single ramp design       
      of the latter.  Nevertheless, minimum power consumption                
      requirements and flight qualified component availability               
      precluded the used of more stable A/D converter designs                
      (ACUNA&NESS1974)."
