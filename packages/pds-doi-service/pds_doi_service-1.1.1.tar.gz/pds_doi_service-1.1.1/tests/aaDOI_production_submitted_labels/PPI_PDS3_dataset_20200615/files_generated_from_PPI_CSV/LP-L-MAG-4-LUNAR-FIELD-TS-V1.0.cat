    Lunar Prospector magnetometer (MAG) Level 2 Data (CODMAC Level 4).        
    Selected and filtered time series data at 5 second intervals from         
    the Lunar Prospector (LP) polar orbital mission to the Moon               
    (January 1998 to July 1999).  These data represent approximate            
    measurements of the lunar crustal magnetic field with external            
    (solar wind and magnetospheric) fields removed or minimized.              
    Latitude / longitude coverage is limited to specific regions              
    overpassed by thespacecraft during the selected intervals.  Vector        
    magnetic field components are given in two coordinate systems:            
    Selenographic (SG) coordinates and east, north, and radial (ENR)          
    coordinates.

    The measured parameters consist of the three vector components            
    of the lunar crustal magnetic field in SG and ENR coordinates             
    sampled at 5-second intervals.  The units of the field measurements       
    are nanoTeslas (nT). 1 nT = 0.00001 Gauss.  SG coordinates is a           
    system centered in the Moon with X directed toward 0 N, 0 E, Z            
    directed toward the north selenographic pole, and Y directed toward       
    0 N, 90 E.  ENR coordinates are centered at the instantaneous             
    spacecraft location with X directed eastward, Y directed northward,       
    and Z directed radial to the Moon.

    Data were first selected from magnetically quiet periods when the         
    Moon was in a lobe of the Earth's magnetotail or when the Moon was in     
    the solar wind but the spacecraft was in the lunar wake.                  
    Hand-editing was applied to eliminate intervals of obvious                
    transient external fields.  Finally, long-wavelength (&#10095; 500 km)           
    non-lunar fields were minimized (detrended) using a suitable filter.

    These data have been examined by the data producer, and as of             
    2003-10-01 are being prepared for peer review by the PDS.

  Limitations:                                                                
  ============                                                                
                                                                              
    The quality of the measurements is a strong function                      
    of the spacecraft altitude, which varies from a minimum of about 80       
    km during the first year of the mission to about 15 km during the         
    final six months of the mission.  The best crustal field measurements     
    were therefore obtained during the final ''extended mission'' phase       
    when the orbit periapsis was lowest.  The surface resolution of the       
    measurements is normally of the same order as the spacecraft              
    altitude.  However, at the lowest altitudes (about 15 km), the            
    resolution is limited also by the orbit track separation, which is        
    approximately 30 km at the lunar equator.  The accuracy to which the      
    crustal field is measured at a single point along the spacecraft          
    trajectory is limited by residual external field variations and is        
    approximately 0.1 nT.
