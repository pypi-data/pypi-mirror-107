    The Electron Reflectometer Data Record (ERDR) is a time ordered

    electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) averaged over a 360 x 14

    as the spacecraft orbits the planet the ER field of view sweeps out

    The ERDR is intended to be used in conjunction with MGS Magnetometer      
    (MAG) data records, which provide the magnetic field vector and           
    spacecraft ephemeris data as a function of time.  Electrons travel        
    along the magnetic field lines in tight helices (few km radius) at        
    high speed (roughly one Mars diameter per second).  Thus the              
    electron data contain information about the plasma environment as         
    well as the large-scale configuration of the magnetic field, which        
    is sampled locally by the MAG.

    The Mars Global Surveyor ER data set consists of a time ordered           
    series of electron flux measurements in 19 energy channels, ranging       
    from 10 eV to 20 keV.  The ER data are organized into ''packets,''        
    each of which contains 12, 24, or 48 seconds of data, respectively,       
    for high, medium, and low spacecraft telemetry rates.  Each packet        
    is further subdivided into samples.  There are from 1 to 6 samples        
    per packet, depending on the energy channel, as given in the table        
    below.  The ER data set is generated at the rate of 6 samples per         
    packet, regardless of energy.  When there are fewer than 6 samples        
    per packet at a particular energy, data values are repeated in order      
    to maintain a uniform table.  The time listed for each record is the      
    center of the sampling interval.  When records are repeated, taking       
    an average of the times for all repeated records provides the center      
    time for that sample.                                                     
                                                                              
    The energy channels and sampling intervals are as follows:

    The ER has a 360 x 14 degree disk-shaped field of view.  The 360          
    degrees are divided into 16 angular sectors, each with a separate         
    counter that is read out in telemetry.  The sizes and look                
    directions of these sectors are programmable to within an accuracy        
    of 1.4 degrees.  For these data, the FOV is divided into 16 equally       
    sized 22.5 x 14 degree sectors that remained fixed in spacecraft          
    coordinates.                                                              
                                                                              
    Throughout pre-mapping, some of these sectors were masked because of      
    obstructions in the FOV, most notably the stowed high gain antenna        
    (HGA), which blocked 3 sectors.  Three additional sectors are             
    partially obstructed by the -Y solar array gimbal/yoke assembly and       
    corners of the spacecraft bus.  Apart from the HGA, these                 
    obstructions are minimal, so data from these sectors are still            
    considered to be of good quality.  After HGA deployment just prior        
    to mapping, the entire FOV became useable.  An in-flight calibration      
    was then performed to determine the relative instrumental                 
    sensitivity around the FOV to an accuracy of about 10%.  For this         
    mapping data set, we average data from all 16 sectors to form a           
    scalar ''omnidirectional'' value.

  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
    Processing is carried out at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) of       
    the University of California, Berkeley, (UCB) to convert the raw          
    data to measurements of the omnidirectional electron flux (cm-2 s-1       
    ster-1 eV-1).  Because of the instrument's high dynamic range (six        
    decades), the onboard digital processing unit (DPU) compresses the        
    raw counts in a logarithmic scale.  The first step is to decompress       
    the raw counts and construct a three-dimensional data array, where        
    the first dimension is time (6 elements per telemetry packet), the        
    second dimension is direction around the FOV (16 elements), and the       
    third dimension is energy (19 elements).                                  
                                                                              
    The next step is to sum over the 16 angular sectors to produce a          
    two-dimensional time/energy array.  Raw count rate (R) is then            
    obtained by dividing the raw counts by the integration time (0.0625       
    sec per energy step).  The data are next corrected for deadtime.          
    During the time it takes the instrument to process a single electron      
    (known as the ''deadtime'', which is about 0.4 microsec for the ER),      
    it ignores any other electrons.  The raw count rate is multiplied by      
    the factor 1/(1 - RT), where T is the deadtime, to obtain corrected       
    count rate.  Data values are masked (set to -9.999e-9) when the           
    deadtime correction factor exceeds 1.25.  These data are NOT              
    CORRECTED for a background count rate due to cosmic rays and noise        
    in the electronics (about 10 counts/sec).  Most of the time, the          
    signal in the highest energy channel (13-20 keV) is dominated by          
    background.  Exceptions to this sometimes occur during bowshock           
    crossings or during energetic solar events.  Assuming that the            
    highest energy channel contains 100% background, the background           
    level for the lower energy channels can be estimated as follows:          
                                                                              
      Channels  0-10 (92 eV - 20 keV): B(E) = B(20 keV) * (20 keV/E)          
      Channels 11-18 (10 eV - 87 eV):  B(E) = B(20 keV) * (20 keV/E) *        
        43.5                                                                  
                                                                              
    where B(E) is the background level (in units of cm-2 s-1 ster-1           
    eV-1) at energy E.  The background is typically negligible at             
    energies below about 1 keV.  Background correction is essential at        
    higher energies.                                                          
                                                                              
    Data are collected through two separate apertures that differ in          
    their transmission by a factor of 43.5.  At low energies (10 eV to        
    87 eV), the smaller aperture is used to attenuate high fluxes, and        
    at high energies (92 eV to 20 keV), the larger aperture is used to        
    maximize the sensitivity to low fluxes.  The corrected count rates        
    in energy channels 11-18 (10-87 eV) are multiplied by the factor          
    43.5 to compensate for the smaller aperture size.  Finally, we            
    divide by the geometric factor (0.02 cm2 ster) and the center energy      
    (eV) to obtain the differential flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1).              
                                                                              
    The data are organized into a table with a uniform time step for all      
    energy channels.  Since the sampling interval is different for            
    different energy channels, data values are repeated within each           
    packet, as necessary, to enforce a uniform time step.  The data are       
    sent via FTP to the Principal Investigator (Mario Acuna) at Goddard       
    Space Flight Center (GSFC), where they are incorporated with the

    The ER is mounted on the spacecraft body, where measurements are          
    susceptible to spacecraft charging and FOV blockage.  This ER             
    instrument design is typically used on a rapidly spinning spacecraft      
    (few seconds period), on which the disk-shaped FOV would sweep out        
    the entire sky in a time that is short compared with most                 
    timescales of interest.  However, since MGS spins slowly (once per        
    orbit), each data record covers only a small region of the sky.           
    Despite this limitation, the scalar flux provided in the ERDR is          
    suitable for identification of plasma boundaries (bow shock,              
    magnetic pile-up boundary, ionopause) and following the evolution of      
    the electron energy distribution, which is useful for evaluation of       
    the plasma environment and interpretation of the magnetometer data.       
    Any application of these data that requires an unbiased average over      
    all look directions (4-pi ster) is NOT RECOMMENDED.

  Data Coverage and Quality                                                   
  =========================                                                   
                                                                              
    ER data are recorded continuously.  Data coverage depends almost          
    entirely on the fraction of the spacecraft telemetry that can be          
    received by the DSN.  The mapping orbit lies close to the ionopause       
    altitude.  Because of spatial and temporal variations in the              
    ionopause, the ER can sample several different plasma environments,       
    including the ionosphere, the magnetosheath, the magnetotail, and         
    closed magnetic field lines anchored to remanent crustal sources.         
    Data quality is best when the spacecraft is within the planet's           
    shadow.  In sunlight, data quality is a function of spacecraft            
    rotation phase, since photoelectron contamination depends on the          
    illumination pattern.

  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    The ER is mounted on the spacecraft instrument deck and has a             
    disk-shaped FOV that is orthogonal to the spacecraft XY plane and         
    nearly orthogonal to the spacecraft Y axis.  (There is a 10-degree        
    rotation about the Z axis to minimize spacecraft obstructions in the      
    FOV.)  This 360-degree FOV is divided into 16 angular sectors, each       
    22.5 degrees wide.  Throughout mapping, the ER is in                      
    ''fixed-sector'' mode, meaning that these 16 angular sectors              
    remained constant in the spacecraft reference frame, sweeping out         
    the entire sky every 1/2 of an orbit.                                     
                                                                              
    Parts of the spacecraft are within the instrument's FOV.  The high        
    gain antenna (HGA), which blocked ~70 degrees of the FOV during           
    aerobraking is not in the FOV during mapping.  Smaller amounts of         
    blockage are caused by attitude control thrusters and the -Y solar        
    array gimbal and yoke assembly.  One effect this has on the               
    measurements is to block ambient electrons from the directions of         
    the obstacles. This is most clearly seen at high energies (&#10095; 100          
    eV), which are only slightly deflected by the spacecraft floating         
    potential.  In addition, when these obstacles are illuminated by the      
    sun, they emit photoelectrons up to ~50 eV, which can enter the ER        
    aperture and elevate the counting rate at low energies.  The              
    detailed signature of this effect depends on the illumination             
    pattern as the spacecraft rotates, which is a function of the angles      
    between Earth, Mars, and the Sun.  These angles varied throughout         
    the mapping phase. Photoelectron contamination has not been removed       
    from the data; however, the presence of contamination is readily          
    identified in the low energy channels (&#10094; 50 eV) by a sharp (nearly        
    discontinuous) increase in counting rate which appears at regular         
    100-minute intervals.  The contamination disappears as abruptly as        
    it appears.                                                               
                                                                              
    For a duration of ~4 minutes every 1/2 spacecraft spin (when the          
    spacecraft illuminated) sunlight can directly enter the ER aperture       
    and scatter inside the instrument, creating secondary electrons.          
    (Note: the spacecraft spins once per orbit to keep the nadir deck         
    pointed at the planet.)  A tiny fraction of these photons and             
    secondary electrons can scatter down to the anode and create a            
    ''pulse'' of spurious counts.  This sunlight pulse appears at all         
    energies, but is most noticeable from 10 to 80 eV and above 1 keV.        
    Sunlight pulses have not been removed from the data.                      
                                                                              
    The instrument's energy scale is referenced to spacecraft ground.         
    In sunlight, spacecraft ground floats a few volts positive relative       
    to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  Electrons are         
    accelerated by the spacecraft potential before they can enter the ER      
    aperture, thus all energies are shifted upward by a few eV.  In           
    addition to shifting the electron energy, the trajectories of low         
    energy electrons can be significantly bent by electric fields around
