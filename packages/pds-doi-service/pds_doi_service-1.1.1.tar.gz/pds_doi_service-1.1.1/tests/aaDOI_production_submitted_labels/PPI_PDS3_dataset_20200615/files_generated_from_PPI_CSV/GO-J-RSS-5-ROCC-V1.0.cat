      For Jupiter electron density profiles are tables of electron    
      density (and its uncertainty) versus radial distance from       
      Jupiter's center of mass to the closest approach of the ray     
      path, altitude of the closest point on the ray path above the   
      one-bar pressure level; planetocentric north latitude; and      
      planetocentric east longitude (System III).                     
                                                                      
      For Io electron density profiles are tables of electron density 
      (and its uncertainty) versus radial distance from Io's center   
      of mass to the closest approach of the ray path, altitude of    
      the closest point on the ray path above the surface (reference  
      radius); planetocentric north latitude; and planetocentric east 
      longitude in body fixed coordinates.                            
                                                                      
      A header record prepended to each table provides information    
      on observing times and geometry and on files used in the data   
      processing.                                                     
                                                                      
                                                                      
    Processing                                                        
    ==========                                                        
      Ionosphere electron density profiles were derived from raw      
      receiver output in several steps.                               
                                                                      
      First, deterministic sources of frequency change were           
      identified and removed coherently.  These included motion       
      of the spacecraft, motion of the Earth receiving station,       
      drift of the UltraStable Oscillator (USO), and relativistic     
      effects associated with gravity fields of solar system          
      bodies.  This left the carrier signal at a known frequency      
      except for phase drift associated with passage of the radio     
      ray through the ionosphere.                                     
                                                                      
      Second, using an accurate reconstruction of the spacecraft      
      trajectory, the phase of the signal versus time was converted   
      into a measure of refraction angle versus impact parameter --   
      the perpendicular distance between the incoming raypath and     
      the center of curvature of the atmosphere.                      
                                                                      
      Third, the index of refraction versus radius was obtained       
      using an Abel inversion [FJELDBOETAL1971].  Refractive index    
      versus radius was converted to density of free electrons        
      versus radius using a method described by [YEH&LIU1972].

      collected using the Galileo Orbiter low-gain antenna.  As a     
      result, signal strengths are weak.
