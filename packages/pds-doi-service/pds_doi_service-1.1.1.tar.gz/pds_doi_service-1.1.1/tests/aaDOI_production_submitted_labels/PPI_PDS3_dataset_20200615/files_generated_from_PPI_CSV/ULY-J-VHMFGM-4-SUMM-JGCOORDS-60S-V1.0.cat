      measured by either the VHM (Vector Helium Magnetometer) or FGM         
      (Fluxgate Magnetometer), where xx_xx = Days of Year covered            
      (25 = Jan 25). The three days of closest approach (38-40) are

      one minute averaging interval. BMAGNITUDE is the average of            
      the field magnitude, not the magnitude of the average field            
      vector. Field units are nT. BR, BTHETA and BPHI are one-minute         
      averages of the field components in R-THETA-PHI coordinates            
      (see below).

      VHM files were produced by first averaging high resolution (1s         
      or 2s) field data in inertial spacecraft coordinates. Then the         
      averages were transformed into R-THETA-PHI coordinates, using          
      parameters from the Final SEDR (Supplementary Experiment Data          
      Records). FGM files were produced in a similar manner by R.J.          
      Forsyth at Imperial College. All files were then reformatted           
      at the PDS/PPI Node to provide time tags consistent with those         
      used on the rest of the ULYSSES JUPITER ENCOUNTER CD-ROM               
      (ULY_0001), and merged into multiple day files.

      The field components are given in the R-THETA-PHI system,              
      which is that conventionally used for comparison with models.          
      The R axis is from Jupiter to Ulysses; the THETA axis is               
      perpendicular to R and lies in the plane containing R and              
      Jupiter's rotation axis and is positive southward; PHI                 
      completes the orthogonal right-handed system.                          
                                                                             
      The Ulysses at Jupiter EPHEM data includes all the parameters          
      necessary to transform the field components into System III,           
      ECL50, or inertial spacecraft coordinates. See Computation of          
      Coordinate Transformations, below.                                     
                                                                             
      The paragraphs below give methods for computing transformation         
      matrices using trajectory parameters from the EPHEM files. As          
      an alternative, note that the appendix in [SMITH&WENZEL1993]           
      contains the orbital elements of Ulysses with respect to               
      Jupiter and demonstrates how to calculate the position of              
      Ulysses in System III and other coordinate systems without             
      recourse to trajectory data files.                                     
                                                                             
      The transformation matrix from R-THETA-PHI to System III               
      (1965.0) consists of the column vectors of the R, THETA, and           
      PHI axes expressed in System III. The R-axis in System III is          
      cos(RLATJG) cos(360-RLONJG), cos(RLATJG) sin(360-RLONJG),              
      sin(RLATJG). The PHI axis is the normalized crossproduct J x           
      R, where J is the rotation axis which is just 0,0,1, so the            
      unit vector in the PHI direction is -sin(360-RLONJG),                  
      cos(360-RLONJG), 0. The unit vector in the THETA direction is          
      the crossproduct PHI x R = sin(RLATJG) cos(360-RLONJG),                
      sin(RLATJG) sin(360-RLONJG), -cos(RLATJG).                             
                                                                             
      The transformation matrix from R-THETA-PHI back to ECL50               
      consists of the column vectors of the R, THETA, and PHI axes           
      expressed in ECL50. R is cos(RLATEC) cos(RLONEC), cos(RLATEC)          
      sin(RLONEC), sin(RLATEC). PHI is the normalized crossproduct J         
      x R, where J (North Pole of Jupiter) is given in the reference         
      [SMITH&WENZEL1993] as -92.002 RA, 64.504 DEC, Earth Mean               
      Equinox and Equator 1950.0. Rotating by 23.4458 deg (1950.0            
      obliquity) gives J in ECL50 = (-.015037545, -.035534090,               
      0.999255323). The THETA axis is PHI x R.                               
                                                                             
      Inertial spacecraft coordinates are defined as follows: Z is           
      the Ulysses spin axis, which points approximately towards              
      Earth; X is is perpendicular to Z and lies in the plane                
      containing Z and S, where S is the Ulysses-to-Sun vector. X is         
      positive toward the Sun. Z in ECL50 is cos(AXISLAT)                    
      cos(AXISLON), cos(AXISLAT) sin(AXISLON), sin(AXISLAT). S in            
      ECL50 is -XSU, -YSU, -ZSU. The Y axis is the normalized                
      crossproduct Z x S, and the X axis is Y x Z. The                       
      transformation matrix from ECL50 back to inertial spacecraft           
      coordinates consists of the column vectors X, Y, and Z.                
                                                                             
      The EPHEM data in this submission include all the parameters           
      necessary to calculate the above transformations. In a few             
      cases where the direction of the spin axis was not available           
      in the SEDR, the Ulysses-to-Earth direction was substituted in         
      the EPHEM data. It is suggested that interpolations in time be         
      performed on vector components rather than angles in order to          
      avoid difficulties near 0 or 360, and that double precision            
      arithmetic be used in matrix multiplication."

      =========================                                              
      Since the VHM sensor has greater resolution (4 pT in the +/- 8         
      nT range), it was decided that the best quality dataset would          
      consist of VHM data for the majority of the encounter period           
      and FGM for days 38-40 when the VHM was in saturation.                 
                                                                             
      We feel that both VHM and FGM datasets have been individually          
      calibrated to the best level that we can achieve at this time.         
      It is possible that further small improvements could be made           
      in the cross calibration between the two sensors; in the               
      present dataset the differences between VHM and FGM at the             
      beginning of day 38 and at the end of day 40 are less than 0.5
