       Data Sampling:                                                         
                                                                              
       Data acquisition strategies varied throughout the mission. High        
       time resolution data were acquired only for short intervals near       
       targeted satellite encounters and occasionally elsewhere in the        
       magnetosphere. These data were recorded to tape and played back        
       during the 'cruise' portion of each orbit. During the Jupiter          
       Approach period, most fields and particles (MWG) instruments were      
       off. The magnetometer, on the other hand, acquired low resolution      
       (opt/avg) data. During the bulk of the prime mission, the MWG          
       instruments were allowed to acquire continuous RTS data whenever       
       the spacecraft was inside 50 Jovian radii (Rj). When the MWG was       
       not returning RTS data, MAG used its opt/avg capability to             
       acquire low time resolution averages of the field. In general,         
       these are ~32 minute averages, although some higher rate data          
       (1-8 minute) were used to fill small gaps in RTS data coverage.        
                                                                              
       RTS, opt/avg, and snapshot data were all stored in the MAG             
       internal memory buffer. RTS data were continuously averaged at         
       MAG memory address 4800 and transmitted to Earth in real-time.         
       When an Opt/Avg ON command was given data were stored in the MAG       
       memory buffer beginning at address 4800 and continuing to higher       
       addresses until Opt/Avg OFF was commanded, another Opt/Avg ON was      
       commanded and the MAG buffer began filling at 4800 again, or the       
       MAG memory buffer filled. Opt/avg data was returned to Earth via       
       Memory Read-Out (MRO) as telemetry permitted. Since RTS and            
       opt/avg data used the MAG memory buffer in different ways, they        
       could not be collected simultaneously. Snapshot data, which            
       completely filled the MAG memory buffer, could likewise not be         
       collected simultaneously with opt/avg, and caused periodic spikes      
       in RTS data. Snapshot corruption of RTS data is discussed in more      
       detail in the 'Data Quality and Coverage' section of this              
       document. For a more detailed discussion how MAG RTS, opt/avg,         
       and snapshot data are collected, please refer to                       
       [KIVELSONETAL1992].                                                    
                                                                              
       When high-resolution data were available, but the RTS data were        
       either lost or corrupted, simulated RTS (sRTS) data have been          
       generated from the high-resolution data. sRTS data were averaged       
       down to the RTS rate, then interpolated to be continuous with the      
       existing RTS data.                                                     
                                                                              
       During the prime mission, the RTS data rate varied, depending the      
       downlink capability. MAG has several different possible                
       RTS data rates depending on the telemetry format:

       Similarly, the opt/avg data can be acquired at different rates.        
       The relatively high data rates fill the MAG internal memory            
       buffer more quickly and are only used to cover short data              
       disruptions.

       The instrument has the ability to acquire longer time averages,        
       but these modes were not used at Jupiter.                              
                                                                              
       After the prime mission ended (December 1997), RTS data                
       acquisition was limited to a few days near perijove with the           
       exception of a few orbits. When RTS data were acquired, they were      
       acquired exclusively in the 2 bps (24 sec/sample) telemetry            
       formats. There were no modifications to the opt/avg data               
       acquisition strategy associated with the end of the prime              
       mission.                                                               
                                                                              
       Both the opt/avg and the RTS data processor compute field              
       averages by applying a recursive filter and decimate algorithm to      
       the data. The instrument applies a calibration, decimates vectors      
       down to minor frame (mf) samples (2/3 second) and despins the          
       data using the spin angle value broadcast on the spacecraft bus.       
       The corner frequencies of the recursive filter are provided in         
       tables 1 and 2 for the various sample durations. BOTH RTS AND THE      
       OPT/AVG DATA ARE TIME TAGGED AT THE TIME OF DECIMATION (END
