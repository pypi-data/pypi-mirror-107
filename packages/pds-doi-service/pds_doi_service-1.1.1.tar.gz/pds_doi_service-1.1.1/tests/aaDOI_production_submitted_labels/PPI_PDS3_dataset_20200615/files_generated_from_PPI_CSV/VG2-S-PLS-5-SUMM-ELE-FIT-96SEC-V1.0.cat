          IN COMPUTING RNH1 AND TH1 WE USED THE 3RD TO 7TH CHANNELS ABOVE     
          THE BREAKPOINT ENERGY EB1 AND SUBTRACTED THE COLD COMPONENT FC      
          FROM FE (OBSERVED) BEFORE DOING THE FIT.  IN REALITY THIS FIT       
          WAS DONE ITERATIVELY BETWEEN THE COLD AND HOT COMPONENT FITS        
          (FC=FE-FH AND FH=FE-FC ETC.).  A SIMILAR APPROACH WAS USED IN       
          COMPUTING RNH3,TH3 FOR WHICH A MAXWELLIAN FIT WAS DONE TO THOSE     
          CHANNELS ABOVE EB2.  THE PARAMETERS RNH2,TH2 WERE FIT TO THE        
          UPPER 5 (3 MIN) CHANNELS (GENERALLY ABOVE EB2).  THIS FIT WAS       
          PRIMARILY DONE TO ALLOW PROPER ESTIMATION OF FE TO THE HIGH         
          ENERGY PORTION OF THE SPECTRUM.  IN MANY CASES THERE ARE NOT        
          SUFFICIENT POINTS TO COMPUTE RNH3,TH3 AND RNH2,TH2 DO PROVIDE       
          A FAIR REPRESENTATION OF THE SPECTRUM.  IF RNH1=RNH2=RNH3 THEN      
          YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE 2ND AND 3RD FIT PARAMETERS.  VALUES OF
