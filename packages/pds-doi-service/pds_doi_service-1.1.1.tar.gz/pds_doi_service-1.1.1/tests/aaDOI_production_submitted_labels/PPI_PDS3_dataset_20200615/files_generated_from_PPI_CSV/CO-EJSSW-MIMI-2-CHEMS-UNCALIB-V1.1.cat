    This data set comprises count rates associated with mass, energy, and    
    charge state spectrometer measurements for each telescope of the CHEMS   
    detector in accumulation and science modes.  In addition this data set   
    includes CHEMS PULSE HEIGHT ANALYSIS measurement data for a              
    statistically select sample of the particle measurements. The standard   
    product ID's are:                                                        
                                                                             
    CHEMS Accumulation Rate Data - telescope count rate measurements         
    CHEMS Science Rate Data - mass per charge, mass and charge count rate    
                              measurements.                                  
    CHEMS Pulse Height Analysis Data - Statistically sampled set of          
                                       discrete particle measurements.       
                                                                             
    The data is organized in time by the spin of the spacecraft.  When the   
    spacecraft is in staring mode then the MIMI DPU automatically creates    
    a virtual spin that divides the time collection periods into 16          
    sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16 microsectors and maintains a simple       
    organizational structure for characterizing the collection of the time   
    into time segments.  When the spacecraft is spinning at a minimally      
    defined spin rate (adopted by the MIMI DPU) then the MIMI data is        
    automatically segregated into 16 sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16          
    microsectors.  When the spacecraft is spinning and the LEMMS             
    instrument is rotating the LEMMS rotation period is synchronized to      
    the spacecraft spin period so that there are 16 sectors in a spin, 16    
    subsectors in a sector and 16 microsectors in a subsector.  The CHEMS    
    and INCA instrument collection times are then also keyed to these        
    values.

    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were     
    compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the MIMI      
    flight software onboard and organize the channel data into               
    appropriate time segments.

           Notes regarding the SCLOCK value:                                 
           1.  Only the SCLOCK major segment value is provided - MIMI        
               currently does not have access to the fine SCLOCK value       
               hence SCLOCK resolution is limited to +- 1/2 SCLOCK count     
           2.  The SCLOCK is only available from telemetry at the            
               beginning of each spin. All other published SCLOCKS are       
               derived from the spin starting SCLOCK, the spin numbers       
               (for the current and next available spins), and the spin      
               period.                                                       
           3.  SCLOCK values are assumed to drive the value of the           
               ephemeris times and not vice-versa. All effort is made to     
               validate the published ephemeris times but since updates to   
               the Cassini SCLOCK kernel in SPICE can occur the values of    
               ephemeris time are only as accurate as the currently          
               published Cassini SCLOCK SPICE kernel.

    Included with the CHEMS data set volumes are ancillary data files        
    representing the MIMI Key Parameter (KP) data.  The MIMI KP data is a    
    calibrated subset of the important channels for each of the MIMI         
    detectors.  The subset of channels have been identified to most          
    reasonably show characteristic energetic particle events during the      
    mission.  The KP data is calculated at an arbitrarily defined 60         
    second cadence which is different than the approximate collection        
    times for the instruments as identified below for standard operations:   
    (It must be realized that the collection times vary based upon the       
    telemetry rate but nothing more than a factor of 2, 4, or 8.)

     Data points for each record of the KP data are first Median Quartile    
     Filtered then averaged (except in the case where the median is zero)    
     for each sector.  The sectored data is then interpolated into the 60    
     second data cadence of the KP data file.  The KP data is then           
     converted into a flux in units of 1/(cm^2*sr*sec*KeV) or for the case   
     of CHEMS 1/(cm^2*sr*sec*keV/e)                                          
                                                                             
     Browse plots for each of the KP data files are produced.  There are 7   
     different browse plots available.

    The data in this data set are measurements of count rates based upon     
    the orientation of the CHEMS instrument (CHEMS Center look direction).   
    Particle flux effects are then determined by transforming from a         
    spacecraft centered coordinate system, properly rotated to account for   
    the appropriate CHEMS telescope direction, into whatever external        
    coordinate (reference system) is most appropriate.

    There is no sample software provided as of the writing of this catalog   
    file although the calibration volume does provide algorithms for         
    conversion of count rates into flux.  In general the CHEMS Science       
    data can be converted into a measurement of flux per species with        
    these algorithms and the CHEMS PHA and Accumulation Rates data are       
    used for determining the health and wellness of the CHEMS detectors.

    This data set contains all calibrated data for the CHEMS Detector as     
    part of the Cassini MIMI instrument for the interval described above.    
    Every effort has been made to ensure that all data returned to APL       
    from the spacecraft is included and that the calibrated browse data      
    products are accurate.                                                   
                                                                             
    As of this writing there are no known issues associated with the CHEMS   
    detector that would limit the usability or reliability of the data.

    The MIMI CHEMS data will be reviewed internally by the Cassini MIMI      
    team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will also be peer         
    reviewed by the PDS.

    Only data for interval 5 is provided to PDS due to technical issues in   
    processing.                                                              
                                                                             
    Beginning in February of 2000 the instrument was operated more-or-less   
    continuously with small daily runs of approximately 8 hours.             
    Intermittent data collection occurred during 2002 and 2003 with          
    multiple day gaps in the data
