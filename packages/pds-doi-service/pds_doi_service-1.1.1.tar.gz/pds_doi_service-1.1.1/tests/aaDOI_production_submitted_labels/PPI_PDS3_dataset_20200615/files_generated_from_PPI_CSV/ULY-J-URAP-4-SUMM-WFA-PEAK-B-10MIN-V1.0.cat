      =============                                                          
      URAP  SUMMARY  PLOT  DESCRIPTION                                       
                                                                             
      A URAP Summary Plot is a plot of one day of Ulysses Unified Radio      
      and Plasma (URAP) experiment data.  The URAP experiment consists       
      of five instruments:  Radio Astronomy Receiver (RAR), Plasma           
      Frequency Receiver (PFR), Wave Form Analyzer (WFA), Fast Envelope      
      Sampler (FES), and Sounder (SND). The Summary Plot consists of         
      six plot panels.  Data are plotted in the form of dynamic spectra      
      (3 dimensional plots of wave intensity versus frequency and time,      
      with the degree of darkness proportional to the wave intensity.        
      Frequency is plotted along the vertical axis, and time along the       
      horizontal axis.                                                       
                                                                             
      Most of the data are stretched (assigned a grey shade) between         
      minimum and maximum data values, the maximum being the minimum         
      plus dynamic range designated for a receiver.  The specified           
      dynamic ranges are shown at the right side of the plot, under the      
      heading 'Dyn.  Range'.  A linear interpolation is done between         
      minimum and maximum values to determine the degree of darkness of      
      the plotted data point.  Data at or below the minimum are plotted      
      as white, and data at or above the maximum value are shown as          
      black.  The pixel-font uses a 4x4 dot pattern to represent 16          
      shades of gray.                                                        
                                                                             
      The plot consists of six panels, the first four of which are           
      plotted with time along the horizontal axis.  For these plots the      
      time increment is 128 seconds, which means that 675 time steps         
      are represented along the horizontal axis, corresponding to 24         
      hours of data.  For data with a higher time resolution than this,      
      the maximum data value occurring during a 128 second interval is       
      plotted.  Frequency is plotted along the vertical axis.                
      Frequency labels such as 100K refer to 100 KHz; otherwise the          
      labels refer to Hz.  Dynamic ranges shown at the right of the          
      panels are in telemetry units, except for the WFA ranges, which        
      are in logarithm of floating point DPU-FFT output.  The panels         
      are described in order from top to bottom.                             
                                                                             
      Panel 1  This is a dynamic spectrum of RAR X antenna electric          
               field data.  The full set of 12 high receiver frequencies     
               and 64 low receiver frequencies is plotted, with              
               interpolation done for any missing frequencies                
               (extrapolation is not done).  The high receiver frequencies   
               have a logarithmic spacing between approximately 50 KHz and   
               1 MHz.  The low receiver frequencies are spaced linearly in   
               frequency between 1.25 and 48.5 KHz.                          
                                                                             
      Panel 2  This panel is a dynamic spectrum of electric field data       
               from RAR, PFR and WFA instruments.  The 12 frequencies of     
               the RAR high receiver Z antenna data are plotted.  A gap      
               separates RAR and PFR data.  The PFR data is the peak data    
               from the X antenna.  Thirty-two PFR frequencies are plotted,  
               ranging from 0.5 to 35 KHz.  When the PFR is in fixed tune    
               mode, there are 32 times as many PFR samples at a single      
               frequency.  They are spread across the 32 frequencies, to     
               permit a better representation of the single frequency data.  
               Twenty-four WFA frequencies from the X electric field         
               antenna are plotted at the bottom of the panel.  The low      
               receiver frequencies range between about 0.1 to 5 Hz; the     
               high receiver frequencies range from 9 to 448 Hz.  The        
               frequencies are approximately logarithmically spaced.  The    
               data plotted are average data from the WFA instrument.        
                                                                             
      Panel 3  WFA magnetic field data are plotted here.  The high           
               receiver data (upper 12 frequencies) are always from the Y    
               search coil.  The low receiver (lower 12 frequencies) will    
               be either Y or Z search coil data, depending on which search  
               coil was being sampled (indicated in panel 4).  Frequencies   
               and units are as for the WFA Ex data.                         
                                                                             
      Panel 4  This panel indicates various instrument statuses.  A dark     
               line indicates an 'on' condition, and a light line indicates  
               'off'.  Six status flags are shown.  These are:  a) RAR SUM:  
               The flag indicates whether the RAR is in summation (X+Z)      
               mode.  A dark line indicates summation is on.  There are a    
               pair of lines for this flag.  The top line of the pair        
               indicates RAR high receiver summation, and the second line    
               indicates low RAR receiver summation.  b) RAR POLAR: This     
               flag indicates RAR polarization mode on or off.  Again, the   
               first of the two polarization lines is for the high receiver  
               and the next is for the low receiver.  c) PFR Fast:  a dark   
               line indicates that the PFR is in fast-scan mode; a light     
               line indicates that the mode is slow-scan; no line indicates  
               fixed-tune (single-frequency) mode.  The fixed tune           
               frequency is shown during the fixed tune interval.  Note      
               that the PFR causes a mode (and bit rate) dependent           
               interference in the WFA data.  d) Greater than 10 Hz Ez:      
               This flag indicates that the WFA high receiver data is from   
               the Ez antenna (dark) or, alternatively, from the WFA Bz      
               antenna (light).  Note that neither of these types of data    
               is plotted on the Summary Plot.  (Only Ex data is plotted     
               for the high band EWFA; only By data is plotted for the high  
               band BWFA.) e) Less than 10 Hz By:  This indicates whether    
               the magnetic data in the low receiver is from the By (dark)   
               or Bz (light) antenna.  This flag does correspond to the      
               data plotted for the B lo receiver.  f) 1024 bps:  A dark     
               line indicates 1024 bps data.  A light line indicates 512     
               bps.  A blank corresponds to a bit rate lower than 512 bps    
               or a data gap.                                                
                                                                             
      Panels 5,6  The bottom two side-by-side panels (to the right of        
               the plot label) show data for each observed FES event for     
               high band and low band detectors.  For each event, shown by   
               a straight horizontal line, 1024 data points are taken.  On   
               the plot, however, only the maximum value of 4 contiguous     
               points is displayed.  Up to 56 individual events may be       
               plotted.  The events are plotted from bottom to top of panel  
               in order of their occurrence.  The vertical scale is time of  
               event in hours of the day.  Each event shown represents the   
               most intense FES event observed during 49 formats (a format   
               is 32 sec at 1024 bps).  These panels are in the form of      
               dynamic spectra; therefore the degree of darkness is          
               proportional to the intensity of data observed during event.  
               The FES low and hi band plots show two vertical lines at the  
               beginning of each plot.  These indicate the instrument        
               antenna and filter status.  For the FES high band the Ex      
               antenna is flagged by a black point, and the Ez antenna by a  
               light point.  The 6-60 kHz filter is shown by black, the      
               2-20 kHz filter is designated by a light point and all        
               filters with an upper limit of 6 kHz or lower are designated  
               by a blank.  For the low receiver antenna, a black point      
               indicates Ex, a light point, Ez, and no point, the B search   
               coils.  For the low band filter, a black point indicates      
               2-10 Khz, a light point .6-6 kHz, and no point indicates the  
               upper frequency limit is lower than 2 kHz.  When the FES      
               receiver is attached to the B antenna, the band is always     
               0.01-1 kHz.                                                   
                                                                             
                                                                             
      The option exists for plotting electron plasma frequency fpe, ion      
      plasma frequency fpi and electron gyrofrequency fce as lines on        
      the dynamic spectra.  The fpe data is plotted on the PFR plot,         
      fpi is plotted on the EWFA panel, and fce is shown on the BWFA         
      panel.  These data are obtained from Ulysses files of plasma           
      (SWOOPS) and magnetometer (MAG) data, provided by the respective       
      instrument teams.                                                      
                                                                             
      Various plot labels are printed in the lower left-hand corner of       
      the Summary Plot.  The first 3 lines give date of the plotted          
      data, version number of the Summary Plot program, and date the         
      plot was generated.  The next 2 lines designate the RAR high and       
      low receiver modes at the beginning and end of the plotted time        
      interval.  The modes are M (measure mode), L (linear sweep), and       
      F (freeze mode).  For measure mode, the list number is given           
      after the '#' sign.  For freeze mode, the frequency number             
      follows the '#' sign.  For the low receiver in measure mode, 'F'       
      designates full list, 'E' indicates first half of list, and 'O'        
      implies the second half of the list is used.                           
                                                                             
      The next line indicates RAR background type and offset.                
      Designation for the RAR background determination is as follows:        
      Background type '0' indicates offset values (computed minus            
      standard background values) and dynamic ranges may be specified        
      for the RAR receiver.  Background type '1' indicates that for          
      each frequency a background is computed from the data for that         
      day, and a histogram of data minus background for all frequencies      
      is used to automatically set the offset and dynamic range for          
      each RAR receiver.  The offset and range depend on the percentage      
      of white and black pixels chosen by the user.  The offsets             
      (either chosen or computed) are shown after the '/'.  The 3            
      offsets shown correspond to offsets for the RAR X high, X low,         
      and Z high, respectively.                                              
                                                                             
      The next line shows the minimum and maximum data values in             
      telemetry units for the RAR low X data for the day.  In the next       
      3 lines, distances and angles are given as determined using            
      various locations, namely, Ulysses (U), Sun (S), Jupiter (J), and      
      Earth (E). The last 2 lines give the longitude and latitude of         
      the spacecraft in either heliographic coordinates (_H) or              
      ecliptic coordinates (_E), as determined from the SEDR database.       
                                                                             
       Backgrounds may be computed from the data.  This is done              
       separately for each RAR receiver (RAR X high, RAR X low, RAR Z        
       high) as well as for the non-RAR receivers (PFR, WFA high, WFA        
       low, B WFA high and B WFA low).  The goal is to achieve a full        
       utilization of the gray scale.  To accomplish this, a percentage      
       of white and black pixels is specified, typically 4% white and 4%     
       black.  Histograms of the data values are computed for each           
       panel.  The background and range are defined by these histograms;     
       i.e.  they are calculated to provide the percentages of black and     
       white pixels specified."
