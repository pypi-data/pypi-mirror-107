      This data set consists of HISCALE Composition Aperture                 
      (WARTD) ion counts. These measurements were taken during the           
      Ulysses Jupiter encounter 1991-12-31 to 1992-02-16, and                
      include 1 hour averaged inbound cruise data (1991-12-31 to             
      1992-02-01), and 15 minute averaged encounter data (1992-02-02         
      to 1992-02-16).                                                        
                                                                             
      The Heliosphere Instrument for Spectra, Composition, and               
      Anisotropy at Low Energies is designed to make measurements of         
      interplanetary ions and electrons throughout the entire                
      Ulysses mission.                                                       
                                                                             
      The ions (Ei &#10095; 50 keV) and electrons (Ee &#10095; 30 keV) are                 
      identified uniquely and detected by five separate solid-state          
      detector telescopes that are oriented to give nearly complete          
      pitch-angle coverage from the spinning spacecraft.                     
                                                                             
      Ion elemental abundances are determined by a del E vs E                
      telescope using a thin 5 micrometer front solid state detector         
      element in a three element telescope.  Experiment operation is         
      controlled by a microprocessor-based data system.                      
                                                                             
      Inflight calibration is provided by radioactive sources                
      mounted on telescope covers which can be closed for                    
      calibration purposes and for radiation protection during the           
      course of the mission.                                                 
                                                                             
      Ion and electron spectral information is determined using both         
      broad-energy-range rate channels and a 32 channel pulse-height         
      analyses (channels spaced logarithmically) for more detailed           
      spectra.
