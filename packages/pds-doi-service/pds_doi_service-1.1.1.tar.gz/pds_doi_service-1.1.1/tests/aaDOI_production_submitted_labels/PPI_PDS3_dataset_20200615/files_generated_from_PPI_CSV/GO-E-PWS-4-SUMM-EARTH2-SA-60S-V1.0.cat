  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The spectral information is averaged and binned into 49
    logarithmically-spaced channels from about 6 Hz to 5.6 MHz for the
    electric measurements and 34 channels from about 6 Hz to 75 kHz for
    the magnetic.  Note that these 'channels' do not generally correspond
    to the 158 specific channels described in the instrument description
    document. The reduction in spectral resolution for this data set was
    performed in order to make the set more conducive to use as a browse
    data set.   The sources of this browse data set are the High Frequency
    Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum Analyzer which make
    up the Low Rate Science portion of the PWS.  During the time interval
    spanned by this data set, Galileo approached Earth from the local late
    evening sector, made a close approach to Earth by passing through the
    magnetosphere, plasmasphere, ionosphere, and finally exited the Earth
    system near local dawn."

      CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE          = "

    This data set includes all available Low Rate Science spectrum
    analyzer data within the interval of time covered. The data included
    in this set have been checked for accuracy by including only those
    words from the telemetry stream which did not have parity errors based
    on parity bits included with the data as part of the PWS data
    processing unit functions. The magnetic spectra contain narrowband
    interference lines at 2.4 kHz and harmonics.  Missing data are
    indicated by zero."
