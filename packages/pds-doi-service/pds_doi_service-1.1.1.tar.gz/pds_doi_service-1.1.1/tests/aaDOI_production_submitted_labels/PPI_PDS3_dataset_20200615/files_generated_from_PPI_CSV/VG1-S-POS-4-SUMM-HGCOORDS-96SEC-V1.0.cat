      =================                                                       
      This data set consists of Voyager 1 Saturn encounter                    
      ephemeris data in Heliographic coordinates covering the period          
      START to STOP. Two versions, both covering the same                     
      time period, but containing slightly different data, are                
      provided. One version was generated by the Voyager MAG team             
      from Voyager 1 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI node using the            
      VG1_SAT.TSP and PCK00006.TPC SPICE kernels.                             
                                                                              
      Due to inaccuracies in Voyager SEDR, as well as changes in the          
      values of some key parameters (e.g. Saturn radius) the timing           
      is improved for the SPICE generated data. However, since much           
      of the original analysis was based upon the SEDR generated              
      ephemeris, this data has been included as well.
