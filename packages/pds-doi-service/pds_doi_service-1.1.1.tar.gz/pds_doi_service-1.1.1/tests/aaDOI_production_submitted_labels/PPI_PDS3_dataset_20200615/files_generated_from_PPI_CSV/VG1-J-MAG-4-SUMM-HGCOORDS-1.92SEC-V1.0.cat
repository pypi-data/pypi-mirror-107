    =================                                                        
                                                                             
    This data set includes calibrated magnetic field data acquired by        
    the Voyager 1 Low Field Magnetometer (LFM) during the Jupiter            
    encounter. Coverage begins in the solar wind inbound to Jupiter and      
    continues past the last outbound bowshock crossing. The data are in      
    Heliographic (RTN) coordinates and have been averaged from the 60 ms     
    instrument sample rate to a 1.92 second sample rate. All magnetic        
    field measurements are given in nanoTesla (nT). The magnetic field       
    data are calibrated (see the calibration description included in the     
    Voyager 1 Magnetometer instrument catalog file for details).             
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Parameters                                                               
    ==========                                                               
                                                                             
    The full LFM instrument sample rate is 1 sample per 0.06 seconds.        
    Full telemetry resolution 'detail' data must be obtained from the        
    instrument team. These data have been resampled at 1.92 seconds from     
    the detail data.                                                         
                                                                             
    The LFM has eight dynamic ranges. The instrument is designed switch      
    between dynamic ranges automatically depending upon the observed         
    magnetic field magnitude and fluctuations. Instrument digitization       
    uncertainty depends upon dynamic range as indicated in the following     
    table (from [BEHANNONETAL1977]).

    Counts are measured onboard using 12 bit words that may represent        
    values ranging from 0-4096. Integer counts are converted to magnetic     
    field units (gammas) by subtracting a zero offset, from the measured     
    MAG value and multiplying this difference by the sensitivity of the      
    instrument.

      T - tangetial direction: Omega (the Sun's spin axis) X R (parallel     
          to the Solar Equatorial plane)

    These data originally included an 8-byte flag indicating software or     
    spacecraft hardware intervention which reduced confidence in the         
    data. However, these flags were provided only at a 48 second rate        
    and are not included in this data set. To identify data confidence       
    concerns in this data set please refer to the data flag provided in      
    the 48 second data set. Data confidence conditions apply beginning       
    at the record matching the time tag of the 48 second data and            
    persist for 48 seconds (or 25 records in the 1.92 second data)."
