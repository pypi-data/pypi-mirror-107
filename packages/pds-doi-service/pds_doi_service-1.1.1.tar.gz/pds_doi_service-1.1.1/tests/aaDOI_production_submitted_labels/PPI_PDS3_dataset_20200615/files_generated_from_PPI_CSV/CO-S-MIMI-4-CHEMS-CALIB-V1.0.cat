      Spectrometer (CHEMS) contains a deflection system and an overall field 
      of view of 159 x 4 deg. that is comprised of three distinct energetic  
      particle telescopes each having a field of view of 53 x 4. All         
      telescopes share the same deflection mechanism, but each has its own   
      start and stop microchannel plate (MCP) and its own solid-state        
      detector (SSD). Much of the data returned by CHEMS is separated by     
      telescope. The deflection plate power supply (DPPS) has 32 different   
      voltages that can be applied across the deflection plates. For any     
      single DPPS step, the electrostatic analyzer only transmits incoming   
      ions within a narrow range of energy per charge (a 3% pass band).

      Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of         
      software programs which calibrate, perform the 1 hour averages on the  
      data, and create the spectrograms.                                     
                                                                             
      In the original CHEMS data,  accumulation interval for basic and       
      species rate counters is one DPPS step, which lasts for one subsector, 
      where 16 subsectors make a sector, and 16 sectors make one spin.       
                                                                             
      When the spacecraft is in staring mode then the MIMI DPU automatically 
      creates a virtual spin that divides the time collection periods into 16
      sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16 microsectors and maintains a simple     
      organizational structure for characterizing the collection of the time 
      into time segments. When the spacecraft is spinning at a minimally     
      defined spin rate (adopted by the MIMI DPU) then the MIMI data is      
      automatically segregated into 16 sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16        
      microsectors. Note that for CHEMS, there is a 150 millisecond dead time
      per DPPS step, and this must be subtracted from the subsector duration.
                                                                             
      Converting a species count rate in units of counts/sec into a          
      differential intensity in units of counts/(sec*ster*cm2*keV) requires  
      knowledge of the geometry factor of the instrument, the energy width   
      of the channel, the detection efficiency for ions of that species, and 
      the energy width of the channel expressed as an energy per charge. The 
      procedures for calibrating CHEMS data are described in the section on  
      CHEMS in the MIMI User Guide [VANDEGRIFFETAL2012].

      The data in this data set are measurements of counts/sec/ster/cm^2/keV 
      based upon the orientation of the CHEMS instrument (CHEMS Center look  
      direction). Particle flux effects are then determined by transforming  
      from a spacecraft centered coordinate system, properly rotated to      
      account for the appropriate CHEMS telescope direction, into whatever   
      external coordinate (reference system) is most appropriate.

      part of the Cassini MIMI instrument for the interval described above.
