      This data set consists of 48-second calibrated, averaged wave          
      electric field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave              
      Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the             
      Jovian magnetosphere.  For each 48-second interval, a                  
      geometric average field strength is determined for each of             
      the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies             
      range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are                    
      logarithmically spaced in frequency, four channels per                 
      decade.  Averages are stored in units of volt/meter.  During           
      data gaps where complete 48-second intervals are missing, no           
      entries exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not                   
      zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  Additional                    
      information about this data set and the instrument which               
      produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog.  An                
      overview of the data in this data set can be found in

  Confidence Level Overview                                                  
  =========================                                                  
    This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data              
    within the interval of time covered.  The data set has been              
    cleaned as well as possible for periodic noise spikes due to a           
    stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated grid within          
    the PLS.  The averages do not include these noise spikes.                
    Other possible sources of noise which have not been eliminated           
    include random intense spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz due to          
    the operation of attitude control thrusters.  Other randomly             
    occurring spikes or time periods of intense spikes over the              
    entire frequency range are indicative of telemetry errors.  No           
    attempt has been made to remove spikes since some could be               
    valid data, i.e.  real bursts of wave activity.  The 17.8-Hz             
    channel is sometimes contaminated by interference from the PRA           
    instrument, depending on that instrument's mode.  This                   
    interference is at a relatively constant level.
