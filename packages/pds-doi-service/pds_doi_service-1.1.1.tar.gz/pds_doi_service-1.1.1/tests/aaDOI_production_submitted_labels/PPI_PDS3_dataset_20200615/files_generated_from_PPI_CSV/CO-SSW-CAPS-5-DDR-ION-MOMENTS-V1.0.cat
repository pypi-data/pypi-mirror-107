  ION Moment File Discussion                                                  
  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
     The data provided in this file are the moments of the ion distribution   
     (density, temperature, and flow velocity) derived from measurements      
     from the CAPS/IMS (Ion Mass Spectrometer) [YOUNGETAL2004].  The final    
     adopted geometric factors, efficiencies, and other relevant instrument   
     parameters used to derive these moments are available in the CAPS PDS    
     User's Guide [WILSONETAL2012] and are slightly different than those      
     used in the study of Thomsen et al. [THOMSENETAL2010].  The final        
     values are based on calculations, laboratory calibrations, simulations,  
     and comparison of in-flight data with measurements from other            
     instruments, including CAPS/ELS (Electron Spectrometer [LEWISETAL2008,   
     LEWISETAL2010]) and RPWS (Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation            
     [GURNETTETAL2004]).                                                      
                                                                              
     When the Ion Method Flag is 1, i.e., numerical integration of the        
     Singles (SNG) measurements, the partition of SNG counts into three       
     different species bins (H+, H2+, W+) is based on concurrent              
     measurements of the ion composition available from the Time-of-Flight    
     (TOF) data product from the same instrument (W+ represents the sum       
     of the 'water-group' ion species O+, OH+, H2O+, and H30+).  This         
     partition and the numerical integration algorithm are described in       
     detail in Thomsen et al. [THOMSENETAL2010] and Thomsen and Delapp        
     [THOMSENETAL2005].  While the calculation of the moments (n,T,V) is      
     is done independently for each species [THOMSENETAL2010], for the PDS    
     submission we report only a single velocity vector, which is             
     calculated as a mass- and density- weighted average of the velocities    
     derived for the three species:                                           
                                                                              
       AveV = sum (m_i * n_i * V_i) / sum (m_i * n_i)  where i=H+, H2+, W+    
                                                                              
             (note that the _ indicates that what follows is a subcript)      
                                                                              
     and where m_i and n_i are the ion mass and density of the ith species    
     (m_W+ is taken to be 16, although in practice it makes very little       
     difference whether one takes either extreme, i.e., 16 or 19).  This      
     weighting is based on our experience [e.g., THOMSENETAL2010] that the    
     heavy-ion velocities are more reliable when they are available (hence    
     the weighting by m_i), but if they are not well-determined due to low    
     counts, the light-ion values are to be preferred (hence the weighting    
     by n_i).  The reported temperatures represent averages of the values     
     perpendicular and parallel to the magnetic field.                        
                                                                              
     Because the ion flows within the Saturnian magnetosphere are typically   
     transonic, an accurate measurement of the plasma properties requires     
     that the flow be in the field of view.  Analysis of CAPS measurements    
     has determined that the magnetospheric flows typically lie near the      
     corotation direction [e.g., THOMSENETAL2010].  Therefore, the PDS file   
     includes a flag to tell whether or not the corotation direction lies     
     within the CAPS FOV.  In addition, the numerical moments algorithm       
     does not work if the spacecraft is rolling or if the instrument is not   
     actuating.  Under such conditions, the moments are flagged as 'bad'.     
     Therefore, there are three values for the quality flag: 'Not-bad;        
     corotation direction in FOV', 'Not-bad; corotation direction not in      
     the FOV', and 'Bad (s/c rolling and/or CAPS not actuating)'.

    The data are stored in multiple data files and have been organized        
    in folders, first by higher order data type and then by year.  Each file  
    contains a maximum of 24 hours of data.  Note that data is included in    
    the file based on the start time, and not the end time of the data.       
    Format of the data files can be found in the CAPS instrument archive      
    specification [FURMANETAL2013].  The format can also be found in the      
    .LBL files in the FM/HIGHERORDER/IONMOMT/YYYY specific directory,

    Gaps

      There are many gaps in the CAPS data stream and there are many          
      different sources for these gaps.  Sources of gaps are as follows:      
          a. telemetry outages                                                
          b. data policing violations (CAPS data volume higher than           
             allocated)                                                       
          c. incorrect spacecraft data management commanding                  
          d. telemetry commanding during Cruise                               
          e. instrument anomalies                                             
          f. instrument modes which don't return all data products            
          g. planned instrument power-off and/or sleep periods                
          h. instrument off due to bus imbalance/short issues                 
      When there is no data for a time period, one of the above sources       
      is the reason behind the gap.  There is no indicator to which of        
      the sources is responsible for the gap in data coverage.                
                                                                              
    Poor Data

      Even in environments that are condusive to moment generation, other     
      factors may influence the quality of the calculation.  For each record  
      in the file, there is an associated quality flag that should be         
      examined to determine the teams confidence in the quality of the        
      calculation.

      The main limitation for ION moments is that the data are only           
      generated during periods where the environment is condusive to moment
