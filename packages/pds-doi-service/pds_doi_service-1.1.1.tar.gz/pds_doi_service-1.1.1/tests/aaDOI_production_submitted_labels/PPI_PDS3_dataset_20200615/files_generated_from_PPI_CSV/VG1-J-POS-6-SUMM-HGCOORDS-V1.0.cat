  =================                                                          
    This data set consists of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter ephemeris          
    data in Heliographic coordinates covering the period 1979-02-26          
    to 1979-03-24.  Two versions, both covering the same time                
    period, but containing slightly different data, are provided.            
    One version was generated by the Voyager MAG team from Voyager           
    1 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI node using the VG1_JUP.BSP and          
    PCK00003.TPC SPICE kernels.                                              
                                                                             
    Two versions of the spacecraft ephemeris data are provided as            
    an attempt to correct some of the problems in the Voyager SEDR           
    while preserving the ability to reproduce early results.  The            
    original SEDR data has a variety of problems which may affect            
    the knowledge of the spacecraft position, or conversely, the             
    timing associated with certain events such as ring plane                 
    crossings.  The SPICE SPK kernel provided on this disk includes          
    corrections to some, but not all, of the problems associated             
    with the Voyager SEDR.  The Navigation and Ancillary                     
    Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL may issue a new Voyager SPK           
    kernel in the future that will further improve the knowledge of          
    the spacecraft location in inertial space.                               
                                                                             
    There are other differences in the in the two versions of                
    ephemeris data that are the result of improvements in the                
    knowledge of some of the physical constants associated with              
    Jupiter and its moons.  Since the Voyager era, there have been           
    updates to the orientation of the jovian spin axis right                 
    ascension and declination, the radius of Jupiter, as well as             
    the orbital characteristic and other physical parameters of              
    many of the moons of Jupiter.  These changes affect the stated           
    position of the spacecraft in jovigraphic coordinate systems             
    like System III without changing the position of the spacecraft          
    in inertial space.  The spin rate of Jupiter is not changed              
    from the System III (1965) rate of 9h 55m 29.71sec (870.536              
    deg/day).  The SPICE planetary constants kernel (PCK) contains           
    both the current IAU definitions of the physical constants for           
    the bodies within in the jovian system (as data) as well as the          
    older IAU definitions (as comments).  This is an ASCII text              
    file (PCK00003.TCP) and users of the ephemeris data are                  
    encouraged to review it.

    The Heliographic coordinate system is a heliocentric system              
    defined in the reference epoch of 1950.  The unit vectors which          
    define the coordinate system are as follows:

    X                points towards the the first point of Aries             
                     in the solar equatorial plane on the vernal             
                     equinox of the reference epoch 1950 (positive           
                     away from the Sun)

    Z                points along the Sun's spin axis (positive              
                     above the equatorial plane)

    R (Range)        the distance from the Sun's position at the             
                     reference epoch to the spacecraft in AU                 
                                                                             
    LAT (Latitude)   the angle between the solar equatorial plane            
                     of the reference epoch measured in the plane            
                     containing the solar spin axis of that epoch            
                     (positive above the equatorial plane)                   
                                                                             
    LON (Longitude)  longitude is zero in the direction of the               
                     ascending node at the reference epoch (X                
                     direction) and increasing in the direction of           
                     planetary orbital motion (note that LON does            
                     not rotate with the Sun)                                
                                                                             
    For the SPICE data, the definition used for astronomical units           
    is 1 AU = 149674000 km. The longitude of the ascending node              
    was calculated using the equation:                                       
                                                                             
      LON = 74 [degrees] 22' + 0.84' * ( year - 1900 ).                      
                                                                             
    The inclination of the Sun's North pole measured relative to             
    the ecliptic was defined as being 7 [degrees] 15' in 1950.
