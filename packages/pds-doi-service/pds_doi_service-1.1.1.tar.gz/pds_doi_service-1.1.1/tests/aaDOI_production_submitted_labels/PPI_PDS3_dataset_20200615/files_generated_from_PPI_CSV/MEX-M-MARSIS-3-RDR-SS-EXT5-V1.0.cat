MARSIS Level 2 data products consist of Level 1b data that have been  
uncompressed, corrected for Automated Gain Control, aligned to a      
reference altitude and, except for data acquired using the SS2 mode,  
range-processed after correcting for the distortion of the transmitted
signal caused by the ionosphere. Echoes collected in the acquisition  
(ACQ) phase, having a much smaller bandwidth, do not have a vertical  
resolution sufficient for scientific analysis, and thus are not used  
in generating Reduced Data Records. Geometric information needed to   
locate observations in space and time is also provided in the Data    
Set.

MARSIS data are the result of the processing of groups of echoes      
called frames. A frame is produced by the coherent summation of many  
tens of echoes. Each frame is recorded as a time series of complex    
signal samples. Scientific data in a frame are complemented by a set  
of engineering data, produced by the instrument and recording         
parameter values used in pulse transmission, echo reception and       
on-board processing, and by geometric information needed to locate    
observations in space and time.

==========                                                            
                                                                      
Level 2 processing of subsurface sounding data consists of several    
steps, needed to convert the instrument telemetry into a collection of
radar echoes that can be used for geological analysis and             
interpretation of the Martian subsurface. These are:                  
                                                                      
 Data de-compression: 8-bit spectrum samples are converted back to    
4-byte real numbers.                                                  
                                                                      
 AGC compensation: the gain scaling factor, applied during Automated  
Gain Compensation, is applied to the data.                            
                                                                      
 Receiving time compensation: echoes are shifted in time to refer them
to a common altitude above the Martian ellipsoid.                     
                                                                      
 Range compression: the received signal is convolved with the         
transmitted signal to increase range resolution and signal-to-noise   
ratio.                                                                
                                                                      
 Ionosphere distortion correction: an algorithm to correct ionosphere 
dispersion of the signal, called 'contrast method', is applied to the 
data.                                                                 
                                                                      
Depending on the instrument mode, some of the above steps may not     
apply (for example, range processing is performed on board in mode    
SS2). The final result is a file containing all complex echoes        
collected by MARSIS in the course of a single orbit.                  
                                                                      
                                                                      
                                                                      
Data                                                                  
====                                                                  
                                                                      
Data Products need to accommodate the different data structures       
produced by different subsurface sounding modes of the instrument.    
There is a single type of Data Product specialized into five different
subtypes, one for each subsurface sounding mode:                      
                                                                      
R_SSx           Subsurface Sounding data that have been uncompressed, 
calibrated                                                            
and range-processed, together with geometry information               
                                                                      
Where 'x' stands for a number between 1 and 5.                        
                                                                      
SSx_RDR Data Products consist of two files, one of which contains a   
PDS binary TABLE object while the other is a PDS label describing its 
structure. The first file contains the instrument data proper,        
organised into frames. Each frame corresponds to a record in the file,
which is also a row in the PDS binary TABLE object into which frames  
are organised. A Data Product contains all frames acquired using the  
same instrument mode in tracking (TRK) state during a single orbit.

interval described above. Every effort has been made to ensure that   
all data returned by the spacecraft is included and that processing is
accurate.

The MARSIS EDR data have been reviewed internally by the Mars Express 
MARSIS team prior to release to the PDS. The data set has been also   
peer reviewed by the PSA.                                             
                                                                      
                                                                      
Data Coverage and Quality                                             
=========================                                             
                                                                      
Data in this dataset have been acquired only in the last six months of
the nominal mission, because of the delay in the deployment of the    
MARSIS antenna. Because of this, coverage is limited mainly to        
southern latitudes.                                                   
                                                                      
Data quality in a data product label is indicated through the         
DATA_QUALITY_ID element, and measures the median of the total echo    
power across the orbit. The permitted values of DATA_QUALITY_ID are   
the following:                                                        
                                                                      
 0: data quality unknown                                              
 1: median data quality index in the bottom 25% of computed values    
 2: median data quality index in the bottom 50% of computed values    
 3: median data quality index in the top 50% of computed values       
 4: median data quality index in the top 25% of computed values       
                                                                      
For instrument mode transmitting at two different frequencies,        
DATA_QUALITY_ID reports a value for every frequency.
