Each file within the dataset represents a single PRA high rate frame,         
of duration 48 seconds. Each file contains a 28 octet header, followed        
by 1280000 octets of data.

where all values are unsigned, and multi-octet values are presented           
with the most significant byte first.                                         
                                                                              
The data are 16 bit numbers, most significant byte first, with 0              
indicating unavailable data. The data are presented as a single               
stream of 16 bit numbers. The frame is logically divided into lines           
(although there is no indication of the lines within the file). This          
terminology comes from the fact that in this high rate mode, the PRA          
data are treated exactly as if they were imaging data, and a 48 second        
image comprises 800 horizontal scan lines. Similarly, there are 800           
logical lines within a PRA frame. Each line comprises 800 values,             
representing 400 data pairs. In the high rate mode, the PRA measures          
the flux at two frequencies _simultaneously_ and returns these two data       
sequentially. A sample pair is acquired every (actually every 138.88...       
microseconds), through an RC filter with a 100 microsecond time constant.     
A single line comprises 60 milliseconds of data. Lines are NOT contiguous     
in time. There is a 4444.44... microsecond gap between the ending of one      
line and the start of the succeeding line.                                    
                                                                              
The PRA samples a frequency pair in this manner for 24 seconds. It then       
has the option of switching to a second pair for the final 24 seconds.        
These frequencies are designated Freq. 1 through Freq. 4 in the header.       
The data are presented such that the higher of the relevant frequency         
pair is presented first."                                                     
                                                                              
    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE          = "                                        
                                                                              
Permitted downlink bit error rates are considerably higher for high           
rate operation than for low rate. Consequently, it is not uncommon            
for there to be considerable noise in a high rate frame. The probability      
of any particular datum being incorrect is small, but there are a lot of      
data in a frame. Generally, a datum should not be assumed to be real if       
it forms no part of a pattern and is markedly different from its neighbors.   
Bit error rates are as likely to result in a falsely low reading as a         
falsely high one.                                                             
                                                                              
The data presented are calibrated but not otherwise manipulated. An           
improvement in data quality can often be obtained by making allowance         
for the 2.4 kHz spacecraft switching power supply, whose signal is            
clearly superimposed on much of the PRA high rate data.                       
                                                                              
The noise background is considerably higher for these data than for           
low rate data. This is because of the wide bandwidth usually used             
(200 kHz instead of the 1 kHz used for low rate), which permits many          
harmonics of the spacecraft power supply to appear in the data, as well       
as many of the noise products of other spacecraft subsystems. However,        
most naturally occurring signals last for (at least) several samples          
and have an appearance quite unlike the distinctly regular artificial         
interferences."
