      This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded by       
      the Vector Helium Magnetometer onboard the Pioneer 11 spacecraft,      
      during the close encounter to Jupiter (inside 7 RJ).  The vector       
      data are provided in Jupiter-centered JG coordinates (see              
      descriptions in Sections of Data Format and Coordinate System for      
      Data).  Also included are the spacecraft trajectory data (distance     
      from Jupiter, latitude, and longitude) in the same coordinates.

      The magnetometer measures the three field components over a            
      frequency range from 0 to 10 Hz.  At encounter the data rate was       
      1024 bits/sec and the magnetometer sampling rate was one vector        
      measurement every 3/16 second, corresponding to 5.33 samples/sec.

      Instrument Calibration                                                 
      ======================                                                 
      The in-flight calibration consists of impressing eight precisely       
      known currents on the sensor coil system and measuring the resulting   
      fields with the magnetometer.  The instrument is designed to carry     
      out a nominal mission with only one instrument-on command.  The        
      instrument comes on in the automatic ranging/spectrum analyzer         
      mode and automatically ranges to the proper scale by comparing         
      the +X and |Z| axis outputs with fixed reference voltages.  The        
      only function commands sent to this instrument during the Pioneer      
      F&G missions were those to initiate the in-flight calibration          
      sequence periodically during the cruise phase.  At the conclusion      
      of this sequence the instrument automatically returned to the          
      automatic ranging mode.  A 6-bit digital house-keeping word            
      indicates the operating mode of the instrument.                        
                                                                             
      The in-flight calibration onboard the Pioneer spacecraft was done      
      by ground command once or twice a week.  The low range sensors were    
      calibrated at field magnitude of 13 GAMMA and 26 GAMMA during the      
      interplanetary cruise period.  While the high range sensors were       
      calibrated near planetary encounter where the field magnitude was      
      as high as +- 43,000 GAMMA and 86,800 GAMMA. There are two kind of     
      instrument calibration parameters, sensor scale factor (gain) and      
      offset.                                                                
                                                                             
      The conventional approach to checking the magnetometer scale           
      factors in flight is to apply calibration field changes, dB to         
      the sensors so that the corresponding voltage change dV can be         
      determined.  Normally several step changes are applied sequentially    
      so that the linearity can be tested directly. After two years of       
      in-flight calibrations, no change has been detected in the Pioneer     
      10 or 11 scale factors which were then known to an accuracy of         
      1 percent or better.                                                   
                                                                             
      The sensor offsets were determined in-flight using two different       
      techniques.   For the two sensors in the spin plane, the offset        
      was calculated by averaging the spinning data in a time interval       
      of an integral number of spin period.  The offset of the spin axis     
      sensor was determined by an adaptation of a variance technique         
      developed by L. Davis [BELCHER1973].  The essential assumption         
      was made that over short intervals of time (5 minutes), the            
      fluctuations in the interplanetary field are principally changes       
      in direction and tend to conserve the magnitude of the field. "

      =========================                                              
      The vector helium magnetometer noise spectrum is independent of        
      frequency (white) with a field equivalent power spectral density       
      of 10**-4 GAMMA**2/HZ.  For signal bandwidths less than 1 Hz,          
      corresponding for example to values averaged over a few seconds        
      or more, fields smaller than 0.01 GAMMA can be detected.               
                                                                             
      The maximum relative error of the magnetometer sensors is given by     
                 dB/B &#10094;= dB0/B + dk/k                                        
      where B0 is the total offset error and dk is the scale factor error.   
      The scale factor accuracy is as good as 1%.  And the total offset      
      error is mainly caused by the spin axis sensor error because it        
      is not readily determined as the two in spin-plane sensors.  The       
      ratio of the standard deviation of the offset in spinning axis         
      to the field magnitude is about 0.05.  Thus, the maximum relative      
      error in the magnetic field measurement is 0.06.
