  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This dataset contains the Galileo spacecraft trajectory during the
    Earth-2 flyby. The data have been derived from SPICE kernels at a 1
    minute sample rate. The data are provided in both Geocentric Solar
    Ecliptic (GSE) and Geocentric Solar Magnetic (GSM) coordinates and
    are given in units of earth radii (Re) where 1 Re = 6378 km.

  ==================                                                          
    The Galileo trajectory data are being archived in 2 coordinate            
    systems.  Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE) and Geocentric Solar            
    Magnetic (GSM) are related earth centered coordinate systems. Both        
    the GSE and GSM X directions are taken along the Earth - Sun line,        
    positive towards the Sun. The GSE Z direction is parallel to the          
    ecliptic normal, positive northward, and Y completes the                  
    right-handed set (towards dusk). For GSM, the X-Z plane contains          
    the Earth's dipole moment vector, positive northward, and Y               
    completes the right-handed set. GSE coordinates are commonly used         
    for analyzing the solar wind near the Earth and GSM coordinates are       
    used when analyzing data inside the Earth's bow shock.

  ===============                                                             
    The trajectory has been derived from the Galileo SPK kernel:              
                                                                              
      'S970311A.BSP'                                                          
                                                                              
    This kernel was obtained by the PDS-PPI node from the PDS-NAIF            
    node. The code which produced the trajectory data was developed and
    executed at PDS-PPI. This code utilized SPICE routines which were
    developed at and distributed by PDS-NAIF. Both SPICE kernels and
    code may be available through PDS-NAIF."

  Confidence Level Overview
  =========================
    The data have been derived from the Galileo SPICE kernels using
    well tested software from the SPICELIB and GLLSPICE subroutine
    libraries. Each data point is computed using S/C and planetary
    ephemerides computed at the time of the dataset sample (not
    interpolated)."
