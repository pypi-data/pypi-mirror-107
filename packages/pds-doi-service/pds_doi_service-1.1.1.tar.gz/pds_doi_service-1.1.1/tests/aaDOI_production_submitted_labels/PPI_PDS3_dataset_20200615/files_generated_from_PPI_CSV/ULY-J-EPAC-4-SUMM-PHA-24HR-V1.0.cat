      This data set contains Ulysses Energetic Particle Composition          
      Experiment (EPAC) pulse height analysis data in 1 day (24 hr)          
      files. Data are provided for the time period from 1992-Jan-25 to       
      1992-Feb-29.                                                           
                                                                             
    Data                                                                     
    ====                                                                     
      Most files are provied in both binary and ascii formats that           
      contain the same information but in a slightly different format.       
      The file naming convention is EV92xxx (.BIN binary) or (.TAB ascii     
      table) where the xxx is the day of 1992. Each file is described by     
      a detached PDS label file (.LBL).                                      
                                                                             
      The data entries in the ascii files are integer energy and delta       
      energy of each event starting at midnight for each day.                
      Time values are not assigned to individual event. The entries are      
      separated by blanks. Then the total length of the ASCII                
      records are: 41 Bytes with a variable number of records per file.

      In addition to the data files, the EPAC instrument team has            
      provided two pieces of IDL code. The program CHANTOEN.TXT will         
      convert EPAC channel numbers to energy (MeV). The program              
      EPAC_EV.TXT reads the all available PHA data and generates a           
      postscript plot file 'epac-ev.ps'. The postscript output of            
      EPAC_EV.PRO for this data submission also included with this           
      archive (EPAC_EV.PS). A second postscript file, (EXAMPLE.PS) shows     
      a more fully annotated version of the output of this program for       
      170 days in the solar wind in 1998. In addition to the data, the       
      annotated plot shows the theoretical traces of several atomic          
      species (He - Fe) for comparison purposes.                             
                                                                             
      GIF files have been made of the postscript provided by the EPAC        
      team by the PDS (EPAC_EV.GIF,  EXAMPLE.GIF) to facilitate viewing
