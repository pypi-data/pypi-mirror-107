  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The rates reported are in unites of counts/sec.  Each entry in the
    browse document is averaged over a fifteen minute time span by the
    'Quality Controlled Averaging' routine developed by Dennis Haggerty
    and Tom Armstrong as part of the Ulysses HiScale project [HAGGERTY93].
    The energetic particle data included in this browse set are summarized
    by Williams et al. [WILLIAMSETAL91].
