   This data set gives the best available values for ion densities,           
   temperatures, and velocities near Neptune derived from data                
   obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment.  All parameters are           
   obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function            
   of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a non-linear        
   least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which,         
   when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the          
   data. The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is         
   not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the            
   separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the           
   plasma is co-moving). In the upstream solar wind protons are fit           
   to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain        
   accurate plasma parameters.  In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low      
   that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase the       
   signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be reliably       
   fit.  These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton Maxwellians with      
   the same velocity.  The values given in the upstream magnetosheath         
   are the total density and the density-weighted temperature.  In both       
   the upstream solar wind and magnetosheath full vector velocities,          
   densities and temperatures are derived for each fit component.  In         
   the magnetosphere, spectra do not contain enough information to            
   obtain full velocity vectors, so flow is assumed to be purely              
   azimuthal. In some cases the azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter,        
   in some cases rigid corotation is assumed.  In the 'outer'                 
   magnetosphere (L&#10095;5) two distinct current peaks appear in the               
   spectra; these are fit assuming a composition of H+ and N+.  In            
   the inner magnetosphere the plasma is hot and the composition is           
   ambiguous, although two superimposed Maxwellians are still required        
   to fit the data. These spectra are fit using two compositions, one         
   with H+ and N+ and the second with two H+ components.  The N+              
   composition is preferred by the data provider.  All fit values in          
   the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It should be noted           
   that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft                
   potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will           
   effect the density and velocity values.  In the outbound                   
   magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given          
   for velocity, density, and thermal speed. The signal-to-noise ratio        
   in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause, which        
   can result in the analysis giving incorrect values. The L-long             
   spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate               
   determinations parameters in many regions; in particular the               
   temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.

      Ion density: A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per        
      unit volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,        
      or energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or            
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however, mass        
      and charge state are often assumed due to instrument limitations.       
                                                                              
      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.)              
      or their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                
      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will             
      be provided in a single dataset. In general, if more than one           
      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density       
      will be provided which is the sum of the ion densities. If a            
      plasma component does not have a Maxwellian distribution                
      the actual distribution can be represented as the sum of                
      several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each Maxwellian       
      is given.

      Ion velocity: A derived parameter giving the average speed and          
      direction of motion of a plasma or plasma component. The velocity       
      can be obtained by taking the first moment of the distribution          
      function or by simulating the observations with some known              
      distribution function, usually a Maxwellian, to the distribution.       
      Velocities may be given in any of the following coordinate              
      systems:

      Ion thermal speed: A measure of the velocity associated                 
      with the temperature of the ions.  It is formally defined as            
      the Ion Thermal Speed squared equals two times K                        
      (Boltzmann's constant) times T (temperature of ion) divided             
      by M (ion mass). Each component of a plasma has a thermal speed         
      associated with it.                                                     
                                                                              
      Ion Current: A measured parameter equaling the rate at which positive   
      charge is collected by a particle detector. The ions                    
      contributing to this current may be restricted                          
      by energy and/or mass. Since ion charge states may be                   
      greater than one, this quantity generally is                            
      greater than the corresponding ion rate.

    The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is not          
    uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the               
    separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the          
    plasma is co-moving).  In the magnetosheath the ion flux so low           
    that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase          
    the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be           
    reliably fit.  These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton             
    Maxwellians with the same velocity.  All fit values in the                
    magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It should be noted that         
    no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft potential,         
    which is probably about -10 V in this region and will effect the          
    density and velocity values. The L-long spectra have too low an           
    energy resolution to permit accurate determinations of parameters         
    in many regions; in particular the temperature and non-radial             
    velocity components may be inaccurate.
