    This data set comprises electric and magnetic field spectral             
    densities for each sensor, binned and averaged (median) into moderate    
    resolution frequency and time bins.  We use 10 spectral channels per     
    decade logarithmically spaced in frequency, usually from 1 Hz to 16      
    MHz, and a 1-minute time step.                                           
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Processing                                                                 
  ==========                                                                 
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were     
    compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the RPWS      
    flight software onboard, apply conversion lookup tables or               
    algorithms to convert telemetry data numbers into physical units,        
    make any corrections required for antenna capacitive loading or          
    other effects, bin the measurements into frequency and time bins,        
    and then determine the median of all measurements within a bin.          
    These data are calibrated using the best calibration tables and          
    algorithms available at the time the data were archived.  See            
    chapters 5 - 11 of the RPWSCAL document in the DOCUMENT directory        
    for details on how the data included in this data set were               
    calibrated.  Should a significant improvement in calibration become      
    available, an erratum will be noted in the erratum section.  Later       
    versions of data products may contain better calibrations.  It           
    should be noted, however, that since measurements from different         
    sensors are binned (via finding the median measurement in the bin)       
    the resulting spectrum is an amalgamation of different sensors           
    oriented in different directions.  Hence, the detailed                   
    interpretation of this data set is not necessarily straight-             
    forward.  If the user is interested in the best calibrated value         
    with a minimum of interpretational issues, the Low Rate Full             
    resolution data product would be the best source of information.

    The RPWS key parameter data set includes tables of wave spectra as a     
    function of time using measurements from each of the various             
    receivers of the RPWS, including the LFR, MFR, and HFR.  Each table      
    will contain fixed-length records including columns for time and         
    spectral densities for each channel.

    Ancillary data included with this data set collection include a          
    series of files that describe the modes of the RPWS as a function of     
    time and provide a time-ordered listing of Instrument Expanded Block     
    (IEB) trigger commands (the mode by which the RPWS is reconfigured).     
    Also a detailed description of each of the modes (or IEBs) is            
    provided.                                                                
                                                                             
    Other data which are ancillary to this data set but which are            
    archived separately from this collection are the Navigation and          
    Ancillary Information Facility's SPICE kernels describing the            
    position and attitude of Cassini and various solar system bodies as      
    a function of time.

  =================                                                          
    The data in this data set are measurements of wave electric and          
    magnetic fields measured by the RPWS electric and magnetic sensors.      
    These fields are presented as detected by the sensors and are not        
    rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE          
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the           
    spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in           
    analyzing these data.  However, for many purposes, the wave              
    amplitudes are extremely useful and may be entirely adequate with no     
    coordinate transformations at all.                                       
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Software

    Since the data are provided in text files as fully calibrated            
    amplitudes, no example software is provided for reading these data.      
    However, a platform-independent Java (TM) application is provided in     
    EXTRAS/SOFTWARE/KEY_BROWSE.JAR which can read these data and produce     
    spectrograms with user-selectable options.  See README.TXT in the

    Cassini RPWS instrument for the intervals described In the product       
    label files.  Every effort has been made to ensure that all data         
    returned to JPL from the spacecraft are included and that the            
    calibration is accurate. A column in each record indicates whether       
    the confidence in the data in that record is high (0) or not (9).        
    The middle band of the MFR (Band 2, 180 - 1500 Hz) has shown a           
    tendency to have an increased noise level by as much as 10 dB at         
    times, although there is no current explanation for this or              
    known factor which would enable this condition to be predicted.          
    In some instrument modes data are collected in the high band of          
    the WFR which can be used to replace the data in MFR Band 2,             
    although this replacement has not been done for this data set.           
    The replacement data are included in the low resolution, fully           
    calibrated data set, however.

    The RPWS calibrated summary key parameter data will be reviewed          
    internally by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS.         
    The data set will also be peer reviewed by the PDS.

    All data in the intervals described in the product label files are       
    included, to the best of our knowledge and attempts to determine         
    completeness.  In general, the instrument was operated only briefly      
    during early tour for the following intervals:

    *Actual interval for science data is much shorter than this.             
                                                                             
    Beginning in February of 2000 the instrument was operated                
    more-or-less continuously; two gaps of the order of six weeks were       
    incurred for the purposes of loading new attitude control and            
    command and data system flight software, gaps of a few days each         
    were incurred approximately twice per year because of Huygens Probe      
    testing, and gaps of several days in duration occurred during solar      
    conjunction periods prior to 2002. Remaining gaps are due to             
    spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply to downlink gaps, some of        
    which were imposed by limitations on DSN station availability.           
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
    One measurement quality issue is occasional elevated noise levels        
    (by a few to 10 dB) in the second band of the MFR. During tour, it       
    is anticipated that data from the Waveform Receiver (WFR) sometimes      
    referred to as the medium frequency digital receiver (MFDR) can be       
    substituted for these in the full resolution data product (RPWS LOW      
    RATE FULL).                                                              
                                                                             
    Beginning approximately with Saturn orbit insertion in early July        
    2005, the RPWS has shown increasing sensitivity in its electric          
    field measurements below 2 kHz to interference from the spacecraft       
    reaction wheels.  The wheels are a source of electromagnetic             
    interference in the magnetic channels at frequencies directly            
    related to the rotation rate of the wheels due to a residual             
    magnetic moment in the wheels.  This level was predicted before          
    launch and has been basically constant through flight.  However, at      
    the earliest opportunity to observe the interference of the wheels       
    on the electric field measurements, there was essentially no             
    detectable level of interference.  However, after orbit insertion,       
    it became clear with increasing time that the wheels were becoming       
    an increasing source of interference in the electric field               
    measurements at about 2 kHz and below.  As of late 2005, the             
    amplitude of this interference is of the order of 30 or 40 dB above      
    the instrument  noise level.  The relation of the frequency of the       
    electric interference to the rotation rate of the wheels is less         
    direct than for the magnetic interference.  There is a general           
    correspondence, but not in detail.  It appears that there are some       
    frequencies more susceptible to the interference than others and         
    when the wheel speed approaches these 'resonances', the interference     
    becomes more visible.  A working model for this interference             
    proposes that radiation effects on some part(s) of the spacecraft,       
    perhaps the thermal blankets, reduce the conductivity.  Small            
    vibrations of this part(s), then, with some residual differential        
    charging then result in the electric field interference.  This model     
    is not confirmed and the true explanation of the interference is         
    unknown, but the effects significantly complicate the interpretation     
    of the electric field spectrum below 2 kHz.

    were processed using invalid SPICE spacecraft clock kernels.             
    Specifically the SCLKs which spice was asked to convert to SCETs         
    were outside the valid correlation region.  The error was subtle at      
    first but continued to grow as SCLKs further from the correlated         
    region were converted to SCETs.  The net result was that incorrect       
    SCET values were placed into the product files and product label         
    files for these dates.  The issue has been corrected and no longer       
    affects any CORPWS datasets available from the PDS.  The following       
    table lists the maximum SCET errors by date.
