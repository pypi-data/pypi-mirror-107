      This data set contains raw Radio Occultation (ROCC) Original Data      
      Records data from the Ulysses (ULY) Solar Corona Experiment (SCE)      
      obtained during the ULY Jupiter flyby. The data target the Io          
      Plasma Torus (IPT) and cover the period 1992-02-03 11:20 to            
      1992-02-09 20:46.                                                      
                                                                             
      The data set includes 41 NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) Original        
      Data Record files (ODR), and documentation. These data are             
      obtained from the Radio Science Support group at JPL. They consist     
      of time-ordered, high-time resolution Doppler data from special        
      radio science receivers (so-called 'open loop' data).                  
                                                                             
      The radio downlinks from Ulysses were monitored during the             
      passage of the spacecraft through the IPT shortly after closest        
      approach to Jupiter. The electron content of the Io torus was          
      derived from the dispersive phase shift of the S-band (2.3 GHz)        
      signal with respect to the X-band (8.4 GHz) signal. Corrections        
      were applied for non-Jovian contributions to the change in             
      electron content arising from the interplanetary medium and the        
      terrestrial ionosphere. Ulysses' North-to-South encounter              
      trajectory was well suited for investigating the global structure      
      of the Jovian plasma environment near Io's orbit, especially its       
      latitudinal extent and azimuthal variations. (IPT investigation

      ==========                                                             
      Open loop data records (ODRs) contain 8-bit samples of receiver        
      output. Each block of (nominally) 500 data samples from each of        
      four receivers (or channels) is accompanied a 166 byte header.         
      Each ODR is accompanied by a full PDS label which describes both       
      the content and format of the file at the bit level. Header            
      information includes:                                                  
           Date and time of first data sample                                
           Sample rate and channel assignments                               
           Receiver local oscillator (POCA) frequency                        
           Attenuator settings                                               
           RMS voltages at several stages in the receiving chain             
                                                                             
      Channel assignments are as follows:                                    
        Channel 1     X-RCP (X-band right circularly polarized)              
        Channel 2     S-RCP (S-band right circularly polarized)              
        Channel 3     X-LCP (X-band left circularly polarized)               
        Channel 4     S-LCP (S-band left circularly polarized)               
                                                                             
      The ODR is described by a Software Interface Specification (SIS),      
      included as RSC1110A.ASC in the DOCUMENT/RSC1110A directory of         
      this volume.

      Open loop data (ODRs) are not edited or otherwise processed before     
      being incorporated into this archive. A 32-byte label at the           
      beginning of each ODR tape is not included in the data file; it        
      gives the software version of the data taking equipment and is         
      saved instead in the PDS label that accompanies the data file.

      ODRs were generated at stations of the NASA Deep Space Network         
      (DSN) and were distributed on 6250 bpi tape. Those tapes have been     
      copied to disk files, defined as PDS TABLE Objects, and archived       
      on this DVD-WO volume. Ancillary data to support analysis are          
      provided in the GEOMETRY, and DOCUMENT directories.                    
                                                                             
      A nominal ODR contains 36000 records, each record having 166 bytes     
      of header data and 2000 bytes of 8-bit sample data.                    
                                                                             
      On this volume ODR files have names of the form 'ydddhhmm.ODR'         
      where 'y' gives the least significant digit of the year, 'ddd' is      
      the 3-digit day-of-year, 'hh' is the 2-digit hour, and 'mm' is the     
      2-digit minute on which data acquisition for the file began.           
                                                                             
      Each ODR data file is accompanied by a full PDS detached label         
      with name 'ydddhhmm.LBL' which completely describes the contents       
      of the ODR file. The format and contents are also described in         
      RSC1110A.ASC in the DOCUMENT/RSC1110A directory of this archival       
      volume.

      For each ODR, there is a set of ancillary files needed for             
      analysis. These are stored in the DOCUMENT and GEOMETRY                
      directories, as appropriate.

        A NAIF (PDS Navigation and Ancillary Information) 'transfer'         
        format SPK files is provided for the period 1992-01-05 to            
        1995-10-31. This file contains the positions of Ulysses,             
        Jupiter, Earth, the Sun, and Jupiter's four Galilean satellites      
        (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto) in data modules that can be     
        used readily with NAIF Toolkit software. This 'transfer' format      
        SPK file (ULY92106.XSP) is located in the GEOMETRY directory.        
        The XSP file is accompanied by a detached PDS label                  
        (ULY92106.LBL) which describes some of the SPK file's                
        characteristics.                                                     
                                                                             
        Before using 'transfer' NAIF files, the user should convert          
        ASCII carriage-return line-feed delimiters on each record to the     
        default delimiter for text files on the local system, then use       
        the NAIF utility SPACIT to convert the archival file to local        
        binary.

      SPK ephemeris files and quaternion files were produced for the         
      J2000 inertial reference frame. SPICE reader routines may be used      
      to convert these to other coordinate systems.                          
                                                                             
      Other data types are not dependent on definition of a coordinate       
      system.

      Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing these data has been      
      developed at Stanford University, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,       
      and other institutions. Because parsing must be done at the bit        
      level, adaptation of the software to other platforms is not always     
      easy. No software has been prepared for general distribution, and      
      none is included with this archive. Users should refer to the PDS      
      labels and Software Interface Specifications                           
      (/DOCUMENT/RSC1110A/RSC1110A.ASC) for detailed information on file

      The ODR data files have been tested by being read, a histogram         
      computed of sample values, time-averaged power spectra derived         
      from the samples, and one-second averages generated of sample          
      power. Data quality concerns discovered in this process are listed     
      the 'Data Coverage and Quality' section below.

      Ulysses' S-band downlink is elliptically polarized with an axial       
      ratio of approximately 2:1. While, with a 2:1 axial ratio, a           
      difference of 10 dB might be expected between the signal-to-noise      
      ratios (SNR) of the S-band LCP and RCP, the actual difference is       
      around 15 dB. This deviation from the expected difference may be       
      attributed to the fact that the value of 2:1 used for the axial        
      ratio is only approximate.                                             
                                                                             
      There appears to be a broad noise apron around the carrier             
      (approx. 10 dB and extending to +/-100 Hz) each time a signal is       
      present.
