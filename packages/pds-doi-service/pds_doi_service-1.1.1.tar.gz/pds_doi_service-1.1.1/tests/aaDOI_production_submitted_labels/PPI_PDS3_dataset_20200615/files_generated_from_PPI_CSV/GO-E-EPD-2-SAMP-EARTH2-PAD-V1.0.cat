  Data Set Overview
  =================
    The angles are determined in a coordinate system defined by the 
    magnetic field (magnetic field data provided by Steve Joy) and the 
    position of Earth (calculated with SPICE kernel data).  The z-axis of
    the coordinate system points along the magnetic field.  The x-axis is
    chosen so Earth lies in the xz plane.  The pitch angle is the angle
    between the sector look direction and the z-axis.  The phase angle is
    the angle between x-axis and the projection of the x-axis on the xy
    plane.  During the encounter, the stepper motor was moving from
    position zero thru five.  Steps one through five are reported in this
    data set.  The rates reported are in units of counts/sec.  Pitch and
    phase angles are recorded in radians.

    Model data is used to fill in a large gap in magnetic field data
    during day 343.  Magnetic field directions from 1992-343T13:40:00Z
    through 1992-343T16:11:00Z are generated by the Tsygenenko 1987
    [TSYGENENKO] model.  During the gap in magnetic field data, the T87
    data is used to calculate the pitch and phase angles.

    Data in this browse set includes only that data which has valid data
    flag markers as a result of processing done by the Galileo Energetic
    Particles Detector Archive Processor [EPDPROC91].  Invalid data are
    marked by a -1.0 in the rate column of the invalid data.  The data
    after hour sixteen is particularly noisy."
