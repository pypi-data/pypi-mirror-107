      This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded          
      by the Fluxgate Magnetometer onboard the Pioneer 11 spacecraft,        
      during the Jupiter encounter period.  Data include 5 minute            
      averages of the magnetic field in both Inertial Heliocentric           
      and System III (1957.0) coordinates.  Spacecraft trajectory            
      data are also provided, in System I and System III (1957.0)            
      coordinates.

      The fluxgate magnetometer data is multiplexed into one of              
      the Science Subcom formats available on the spacecraft.                
      Two separate 6-bit words per subcom cycle are assigned                 
      to the instrument and thus 3 complete cycles are required              
      to read out the contents of the output buff.  At a bit rate            
      of 2048 bps, a complete subcom cycle requires 6 second and             
      a vector measurement is obtained approximately every 18 to             
      24 second depending on the actual roll rate of the spacecraft,         
      which is nominally 5 revolutions per minute (ACUNA&NESS1974).

      System I is a planetographic spherical coordinates at Jupiter.  This   
      system used a relatively faster Jupiter spin rate (877.90 degree per   
      24 hours) to describe cloud features within 10 degree of the equator.  
      The Central Meridian Longitude was established at 12:00 Greenwich Mean 
      Time on July 14, 1897.                                                 
                                                                             
      System III (1957.0) is a planetographic spherical coordinates. In this 
      system, the Jovian rotation period is defined to be 9h55m29.37s        
      and the Central Meridian Longitude is defined at 00:00 UT on           
      January 1, 1957.                                                       
                                                                             
      Inertial Heliocentric coordinates is a Cartesian system, defined based 
      on two principle directions, the Jupiter spin axis J, and the direction
      from the sun to the first point of Aries, X.  The Y direction is given 
      by the cross product of J and X.  The Z direction is defined as the    
      cross product of X and Y.

      The fluxgate magnetometer was calibrated at the GSFC Magnetic          
      Test Facility by means of a 2 meter diameter, single axis              
      Helmholtz coil system.  Typically hysteresis observed after            
      exposure to 2.5 mT fields was less than 1 part in 10**3 (one           
      count).  Temperature stability is better than +- 0.5% over the         
      temperature range of -20 to +40 degree Celsius in spite of the         
      open loop design of the instrument.  This is due to the fact           
      that the characteristics of the magnetic material used in the          
      sensor cores are fairly independent of temperature over the            
      indicated range.  The stability figure includes the A/D converter      
      drift and a large portion of it is due to the single ramp design       
      of the latter.  Nevertheless, minimum power consumption                
      requirements and flight qualified component availability               
      precluded the used of more stable A/D converter designs                
      (ACUNA&NESS1974)."
