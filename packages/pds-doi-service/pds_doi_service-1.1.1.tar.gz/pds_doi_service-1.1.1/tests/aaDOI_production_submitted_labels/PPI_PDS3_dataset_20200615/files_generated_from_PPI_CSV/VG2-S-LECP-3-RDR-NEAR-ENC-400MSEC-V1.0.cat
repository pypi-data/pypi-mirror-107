    Data Set Description
    --------------------
      This near encounter data set consists of electron and ion
      counting rate data from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP)
      experiment on Voyager 1 while the spacecraft was within the
      very close vicinity of Saturn. This instrument measures the
      intensities of in-situ charged particles ( &#10095;13 keV electrons
      and &#10095;24 keV ions) with various levels of discrimination based
      on energy range and mass species. A subset of almost 100 LECP
      channels are included in this data set. The LECP data are
      globally calibrated to the extent possible.  During Saturn
      near encounter, the LEMPA (Low Energy Magnetospheric Particle
      Analyzer) subsystem was turned on for data collection.
      Particles include low energy electrons, protons, alpha
      particles, medium energy protons and ions, high energy and
      intensity protons, electrons, alpha particles, and Z &#10095;= nuclei.
      The near encounter data are 0.4 second rate measurements within
      1/8 of the LECP instrumental motor rotation period (the
      angular scanning periods, or step period).

      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular
      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles.
      A gear-drive motor steps through eight equal angular sectors
      per revolution for data collection. The cycle time for the
      rotation is 48 minutes or 25.6 minutes during cruise mode,
      and 192 second or 48 second during the planetary encounter.

      The data were originally collected in the form of 'rates',
      which were not always converted into the usual physical
      units. The reason is that such a conversion would depend on
      uncertain determinations such as the mass species of the
      particles and the level of background. Both mass species
      and background are generally determined from context during
      the study of particular regions. To convert 'rate' to
      'intensity' for a particular channel one performs the
      following tasks: 1) decide on the level of background
      contamination and subtract that off the given rate level.
      Background is to be determined from context and from making
      use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 is covered by a 2 mm
      Aluminium sunshield and used for data calibration).
      2) Divide the background corrected rate by the channel
      geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the channel.
      To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge the mass
      species of the detected particles (for ions but not for
      electrons). The energy band passes are given in the form
      of 'energy/nucleon'. For channels that begin their names
      with the designations 'ch' these bandpasses can be used on
      mass species that are accepted into that channel, which
      gives the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these
      entries are blank for electron channels). For other channels
      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value
      accepted. The bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all
      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.
      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]). The final product of these
      instructions will be the particle intensity in the
      unit of 'counts/(cm**2 sr sec keV)'.  LECP data can
      also be in the form of flux, whose unit is
      'cm**-1 sr**-1 sec**-1'.

  Confidence Level Overview                                               
  =========================                                               
    At all times during this planetary encounter there exist data           
    in this data set that can be rated with the highest confidence          
    level. However, some of the channels of data are contaminated           
    by various kinds and various levels of contaminations. It is            
    therefore imperative, in using this data set, that the                  
    contamination tables within the catalog be examined. Also, not          
    all kinds of contamination have been fully documented. When in          
    doubt the data supplier must be contacted.                              
                                                                            
    Some channels are subject to serious contaminations, and many           
    of these contaminations cannot be removed except with a region-         
    by-region analysis, which has not been done for this data.              
    Thus, to use this data it is absolutely vital that the                  
    contamination types ('CONTAMINATION_ID' , 'CONTAMINATION_DESC')         
    and the levels of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID'                      
    corresponding to the definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be                
    carefully examined for all regions of study. A dead time                
    correction procedure has been applied in an attempt to correct          
    the linear effects of detector overdrive (pulse-pileup). This           
    procedure does not fix severely overdriven detectors. A                 
    procedure is available for correcting Voyager 2 LECP electron           
    contamination of low energy ion channels, but its effectiveness         
    has been evaluated only for the Uranus data set. Thus,                  
    corrections have been applied only to the Uranus data set.              
                                                                            
  Missing Data Flag

    Any data column whose value is NULL is a missing data value."
