==================                                                            
                                                                              
This dataset contains 29 ionospheric electron density profiles                
(EDS files) derived from Venera 15 and 16 radio occultation data.             
A total of 155 profiles are believed to be available and it is                
hoped that all will eventually be archived. These profiles were               
produced by A. L. Gavrik, who worked on the Venera 15 and 16 radio            
occultation experiment, and prepared for the PDS by P. Withers.               
                                                                              
The DATA/ directory contains one .TAB file and one .LBL file for each         
occultation. Each .TAB file contains a series of altitudes and                
electron densities for an occultation. The LBL file contains                  
information about how to read the data and some ancillary information         
about the data acquisition (time, location, etc.).                            
                                                                              
Each .TAB file in the ANC/ directory obeys the following naming               
convention:                                                                   
                                                                              
ANCYYYYMMDDHXXXQV.TAB                                                         
                                                                              
where YYYY is the year of the occultation (e.g. 1983), MM is the              
month (e.g. 10), DD is the day of the month (e.g. 12), H is a                 
letter corresponding to the hour of the occultation, as discussed             
in the next sentence, XXX is either V15 for Venera 15 occultations            
or V16 for Venera 16 occultations, Q is either N for ingress or X for         
egress, and V is a version label (e.g. A for the first version). An           
occultation time of 05:54:00 has hour 05 and H is 'F'. Similiarly, an hour    
of 00 leads to H being A, 01 to B, 02 to C, and so on until 23 to X. Thus     
filename ANC19831012FV15NA.TAB corresponds to an ingress occultation on       
1983-10-12 at a time with hour 05 by Venera 15, first version. Each           
.LBL file in the ANC/ directory is named in a corresponding manner.           
The same naming convention is used in the EDS/ directory, with the            
replacement of 'ANC' in the filename with 'EDS'.                              
                                                                              
Dates and times used to produce these filenames are in the Moscow             
winter timezone, not UTC. This is discussed further in the section            
headed 'Timing'.

The name of the original file supplied by A. L. Gavrik may contain            
useful information. These files appear to follow some naming convention,      
but this convention has not yet been fully understood. For instance,          
information on the occultation summarized in file ANC19831012FV15A.TAB        
was originally delivered in a file named 0566_b15.012.                        
                                                                              
Each .TAB file in the EDS/ directory contains the following items.            
                                                                              
Altitude, km                                     ALTITUDE                     
Electron density, number per cubic centimeter    ELECTRON_DENSITY             
                                                                              
The altitude is presumed to be relative to a sphere of radius 6052 km.        
                                                                              
Uncertainties in these parameters are not specified precisely.                
Uncertainty in absolute altitude is less than 2 km. Relative                  
altitudes for a given occultation are significantly more accurate.            
Uncertainty in electron density varies with altitude, being smaller           
at high altitudes than at low altitudes as a result of the data               
processing techniques used. Hence the smallest electron densities             
reported at low altitudes are significantly smaller than the                  
smallest reported at high altitudes. Uncertainty in electron density          
at high altitude varies between 200 and 5000 electrons per cubic              
centimeter, with a typical value of 500 electrons per cubic centimeter.       
This value is sensitive to fluctuations in the total electron content         
(i.e. electrons per unit area) along the ray of the radio signal.             
Hence it is influenced by properties of the solar wind along the line         
of sight at the time of the occultation. Uncertainty in electron              
density near the ionospheric peak is approximately 10000 to 20000             
electrons per cubic centimeter.

All dates and times reported in this dataset are in the Moscow winter         
timezone, not UTC. This time zone is currently three hours ahead of UTC.      
Times have not been converted into UTC in order to (A) eliminate the          
possibility of introducing an error and (B) retain flexibility in the         
case that delivery of additional profiles from the Venera 15 and 16           
radio occultation experiments involves Moscow summer time.

Data processing is described in the documents listed in the REF.CAT           
file and in some of the other files in the CATALOG/ directory. The            
principal equations used were:

and p = H + L c df / (v-perp f)

transmitter with respect to the receiver, e is the elementary charge,         
df is the residual frequency change caused by the ionosphere of               
Venus, H is the distance of closest approach of the ray to Venus, and         
L is the separation between the spacecraft and Venus. These equations         
are in Gaussian units, inserting 4 pi eps-0, where eps-0 is the               
permittivity of free space, to the numerator of the right hand side           
of the first equation converts them into SI units."

Data Coverage and Quality

Given the small number of available occultations, data coverage is            
limited. No gaps have been identified in individual profiles.                 
Uncertainties in the ionospheric electron densities are not known             
precisely, as discussed above.

These data products come from two Soviet spacecraft whose operations          
ended over 25 years ago. Therefore the documentation and other aspects        
of the dataset are not as complete as would be expected for a current         
NASA mission. Nevertheless, it is felt that archiving the dataset in          
its current state, thereby preserving it for posterity, is better
