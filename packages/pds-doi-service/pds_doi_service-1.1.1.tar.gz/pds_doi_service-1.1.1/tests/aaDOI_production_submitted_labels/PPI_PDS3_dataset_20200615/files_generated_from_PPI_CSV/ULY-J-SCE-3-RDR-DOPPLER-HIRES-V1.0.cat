      The Ulysses spacecraft was occulted by the Io Plasma Torus             
      (IPT) during its Jupiter encounter on 8 February 1992. The             
      Ulysses dual-frequency radio subsystem used by the Ulysses             
      Solar Corona Experiment (SCE) was utilized to measure the              
      electron content (column density) of the IPT [BIRDETAL1992B].          
      In the nominal mode for radio-sounding observations                    
      [BIRDETAL1992A], both downlinks (S-band: f_s = 2.3 GHz;                
      X-band: f_x = 8.4 GHz) are phase coherent with the uplink              
      (S-band: f_u = 2.1 GHz). The dual-frequency radio-sounding             
      technique exploits the dispersive nature of ionized media on           
      the propagation of the two downlinks. The tiny Doppler shift           
      due to plasma moving in and out of the ray path is greater             
      at S-band than at the higher frequency X-band.                         
                                                                             
      The SCE data are obtained from the Radio Science Support group         
      at JPL. There are basically two types of data: Ranging and             
      Doppler (Frequency), recorded as a function of UT Ground               
      Received Time. The raw data are delivered in special binary            
      files called ATDFs (Archival Tracking Data Files), containing          
      Ranging and Doppler data from the standard DSN tracking                
      receivers. There are high-time resolution Doppler data from            
      special radio science receivers (so-called 'open loop' data)           
      as well. These are in files called ODRs (Original Data                 
      Records).                                                              
                                                                             
      ATDFs are files of radiometric data produced by the Network            
      Operations Control Center (NOCC) Navigation Subsystem (NAV).           
      They are derived from Intermediate Data Records by NAV and             
      contain all radiometric measurements received from the DSN             
      station including signal levels (`AGC' = automatic gain                
      control in dBm), antenna pointing angles, frequency (often             
      referred to simply as 'Doppler'), range, and residuals.                
      Doppler data are often used to infer spacecraft radial motion          
      relative to the tracking antenna. Data values in ATDFs are             
      reported at rates no higher than 10 per second. For the                
      Ulysses Jupiter encounter the received frequencies at S-Band           
      and X-band were recorded at a sample time of one per second.           
      Each ATDF data record contains 117 parameters, stored in               
      records of 288 bytes. The ATDF is described in section                 
      TRK-2-25 of the JPL Document 820-13 [DSN820-13].                       
                                                                             
      The ATDFs have been analyzed for the Jupiter encounter and a           
      detailed report has been published [BIRDETAL1993]. Data files          
      have been generated which contain the Ranging and Doppler data         
      at various stages of processing. Stage #1 is generally just            
      stripping the Ranging/Doppler data from the ATDFs. Stage #2 is         
      to 'clean' the data files by weeding out obviously bad data.           
      Stage #3 is to produce a 'final data set', a table of the              
      measured data plus physically relevant quantities as function          
      of time.                                                               
                                                                             
      For the Doppler data, getting to stage #3 involves                     
      manipulating the frequency data to extract the changes in              
      electron column density. An additional complication is the             
      compensation for the Earth's ionosphere to separate its                
      contribution from that of the Io Plasma Torus. This requires           
      obtaining ionospheric calibration data from the DSN for the            
      days of the Jupiter encounter. Details of the calibration              
      procedure can be found in section TRK-2-23 of JPL document             
      820-13 [DSN820-13]. Because the processing to stage #3 can be          
      done in a variety of ways, it is best to leave the frequency           
      measurements in their stage #2 form for the archiving process.         
      In contrast to the modest volume of ranging data, the much             
      higher sample rate increases the Doppler data volume to                
      Megabyte proportions.                                                  
                                                                             
      Data

      The following tables give an idea about the size and coverage          
      of the data set:

      The size of the data set has been reduced by providing only
