    Included in this data set are over 1000 files of raw samples              
    acquired using DSN open-loop receivers and recorders, often               
    in two orthogonal circular polarizations at both wavelengths.

    Each open-loop data file (data type ODR) contains a header                
    followed by several thousand 8-bit sample values from 1-4                 
    receiver output channels.  The header gives the time of the               
    first sample, the antenna through which the data were collected,          
    channel assignments, the local oscillator frequency of the                
    receiver, rms values of each receiver output, status and                  
    condition flags, and other data useful for interpreting the               
    receiver samples.                                                         
                                                                              
    The samples were obtained coherently from one or more of the              
    following receiving systems:                                              
            X-RCP   3.6-cm right circularly polarized                         
            S-RCP   13-cm right circularly polarized                          
            X-LCP   3.6-cm left circularly polarized                          
            S-LCP   13-cm left circularly polarized                           
    Each 8-bit sample represents the band-limited voltage output of           
    one of the receivers above; individual samples were written to            
    the data file, usually in the order given above.                          
                                                                              
    Samples could be collected at rates varying from 100 to 50000             
    per second from each receiver.  The number of samples in each             
    record varied depending on the sampling rate and number of                
    channels being collected.

    Samples from parallel analog-to-digital converters were stored            
    in buffers until the correct number had been accumulated.                 
    Header information was accumulated separately.  When the sample           
    buffer was filled, the samples were combined with the header              
    data and the record was written to tape.                                  
                                                                              
    RMS values of receiver outputs were included in the header.               
    There was no other processing of the data.

      ODR files have names of the form  ydddhhmm.ODR  where  y  is the        
      least significant digit of the year,  ddd  is the 3-digit day-

    Software for parsing, reducing, and analyzing data such as these          
    has been developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Stanford             
    University, and elsewhere.  Because parsing must be done at the           
    bit level, its implementation may be very sensitive to platform           
    and operating system.  No parsing software has been written and           
    tested on a variety of platforms, so none has been included with          
    the archival data set.  Users are referred to PDS labels for              
    detailed information on file formats.

      This collection of 1035 ODR data files spans the time period            
      from 1992/017-09:02:00 through 1992/227-06:31:00.  Solar

      This archival data set was distributed for peer review prior to         
      its acceptance by the Planetary Data System (PDS).  The review          
      was conducted in accordance with PDS procedures.                        
                                                                              
      Prior to creation of the final version of the archival data set,        
      the archive was distributed on CD-WO volumes for preliminary            
      review.  These included data files, PDS labels, and most                
      documentation.

    The data extend from five months before the 1992 Magellan                 
    solar superior conjunction (1992-06-13) to two months after.              
    Data quality is highly variable with the best data collected              
    using 70-m DSN antennas closest to solar conjunction.                     
                                                                              
    Data most useful for Faraday Rotation analysis were collected             
    at S- and X-band using dual orthogonally polarized antennas.              
    This configuration is only possible when using 70-m DSN                   
    antennas.  The following table shows dates, times, and antennas           
    when 70-m antennas were used close to solar conjunction.

  ===========                                                                 
                                                                              
    Some or all of the observations recorded in this data set may             
    have been collected while the spacecraft radio system was in              
    two-way tracking mode.  That is, the signal frequency                     
    transmitted by the spacecraft was referenced to the frequency             
    of a signal it received simultaneously from the ground.  For              
    interpretation, the effects of the solar plasma must be                   
    considered on both the 'uplink' and 'downlink' portions of the            
    path.                                                                     
                                                                              
    During some observations, the reference signal transmitted from           
    the ground may have been 'ramped' -- that is, the frequency of            
    the 'uplink' signal was a linear function of time.  Coefficients          
    of the linear function are saved in the Archival Tracking Data            
    File, but those files are not included in this archive."
