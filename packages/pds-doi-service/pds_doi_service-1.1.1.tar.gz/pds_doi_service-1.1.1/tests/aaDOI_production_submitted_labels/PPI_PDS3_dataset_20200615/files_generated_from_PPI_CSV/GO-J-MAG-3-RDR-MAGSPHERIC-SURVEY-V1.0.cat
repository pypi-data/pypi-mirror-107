    -------------                                                             
      Data acquisition strategies varied throughout the mission. During       
      the Jupiter approach period, most particles and fields (MWG)            
      instruments were off while the magnetometer acquired low                
      resolution opt/avg data. During the bulk of the prime mission,          
      the MWG instruments were allowed to acquire continuous RTS data         
      whenever the spacecraft was inside 50 Jovian radii (Rj). When the       
      MWG was not returning RTS data, MAG used its opt/avg capability to      
      acquire low time resolution averages of the field. In general,          
      these are ~32 minute averages, although some higher rate data (1-8      
      minute) were used to fill small gaps in RTS data coverage. Early        
      in the prime mission, MAG was required to 'pay' for the bits its        
      used to return the opt/avg data by not acquiring as much high           
      resolution data. MAG did not return data from the MWG transauroral      
      crossing recorded interval in the C3 orbit so that it could have        
      continuous coverage during that orbit. After the fourth orbit, the      
      MAG opt/avg data was return in the spacecraft engineering data          
      stream at no cost to the team. The MWG acquired RTS data beyond         
      50 Rj in selected bit rich orbits (G2, G7, G8, C9, C10) during the      
      prime mission.                                                          
                                                                              
      RTS, opt/avg, and snapshot data were all stored in the MAG              
      internal memory buffer. RTS data were continuously averaged at MAG      
      memory address 4800 and transmitted to Earth in real-time. When an      
      opt/avg ON command was given data were stored in the MAG memory         
      buffer beginning at address 4800 and continuing to higher               
      addresses until Opt/Avg OFF was commanded, another Opt/Avg ON was       
      commanded and the MAG buffer began filling at 4800 again, or the        
      MAG memory buffer filled. Opt/avg data was returned to Earth via        
      Memory Read-Out (MRO) as telemetry permitted. Since RTS and             
      opt/avg data used the MAG memory buffer in different ways, they         
      could not be collected simultaneously. Snapshot data, which             
      completely filled the MAG memory buffer, could likewise not be          
      collected simultaneously with opt/avg, and caused periodic spikes       
      in RTS data. Snapshot corruption of RTS data is discussed in more       
      detail in the 'Data Quality and Coverage' section of this               
      document. For a more detailed discussion how MAG RTS, opt/avg, and      
      snapshot data are collected, please refer to [KIVELSONETAL1992].        
                                                                              
      When high-resolution data were available, but the RTS data were         
      either lost or corrupted, simulated RTS (sRTS) data have been           
      generated from the high-resolution data. sRTS data were averaged        
      down to the RTS rate, then interpolated to be continuous with the       
      existing RTS data.                                                      
                                                                              
      During the prime mission, the RTS data rate varied, depending the       
      downlink capability. MAG has several different possible                 
      RTS data rates depending on the telemetry format:

      Similarly, the opt/avg data can be acquired at different rates.         
      The relatively high data rates fill the MAG internal memory buffer      
      more quickly and are only used to cover short data disruptions.

      The instrument has the ability to acquire longer time averages          
      but these modes were not used at Jupiter.                               
                                                                              
      After the prime mission ended (December 1997), RTS data                 
      acquisition was limited to only a few days near perijove except         
      for a few orbits. RTS data are typically in the 2 bps (24               
      sec/sample) telemetry formats. Opt/avg data after end of the            
      prime mission, are primarily provided in 32 RIM (~32 min/sample)        
      averages.                                                               
                                                                              
      Both the opt/avg and the RTS data processor compute field averages      
      by applying a recursive filter and decimate algorithm to the data.      
      The instrument applies a calibration, decimates vectors down to         
      minor frame (mf) samples (2/3 second) and despins the data using        
      the spin angle value broadcast on the spacecraft bus. The corner        
      frequencies of the recursive filter are provided in tables 1 and 2      
      for the various sample durations. The effect of this process is         
      that the spacecraft time tags both RTS and opt/avg data at the          
      time of decimation (end of average), rather than at the effective       
      'center' of the average. As a result there is a time shift or           
      phase delay between RTS or opt/avg data and data (e.g. LPW) which       
      have not undergone the same filtering process. The magnitude of         
      the phase delay is dependent upon the averaging interval (or            
      rate) and frequency content of the data. Analysis of the filter         
      response to a wave at the spin period (dominant frequency) has

      Where the 'Sample time' is the time assigned by the spacecraft,         
      and the 'Rate' is the sampling rate in seconds. Both 'Sample Time'      
      and 'Corrected Time' are provided in the data files. The IRC data       
      file (which does not include a 'Corrected Time' column) contains        
      a 'Spacecraft Clock' column which corresponds to the 'Sample Time'      
      (and not the 'Corrected Time'). The RTS and opt/avg data overlay        
      high time resolution data acquired at the same time best when the       
      'Corrected Time' is used.                                               
                                                                              
      MAG uses fixed gains to acquire data [KIVELSONETAL1992]. Gain           
      states must be manually changed by sending a gain change                
      command to the instrument. There are 3 ranges of field strengths        
      that the instrument can measure:

      While the outboard magnetometer's position on the boom does make        
      it less susceptible to spacecraft fields, its zero levels were          
      less stable than those of the inboard magnetometer. As a result,        
      the outboard magnetometer was generally not used except when the        
      magnetic field strength was very low. The outboard magnetometer         
      was typically only used outside of 60 Rj (in the low field              
      range). From 9-60 Rj the inboard magnetometer, low field range          
      was generally used. Inside of ~9 Rj the inboard magnetometer,           
      high field range was used.                                              
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Processing                                                                  
  ==========                                                                  
    Browse data are primarily processed onboard the spacecraft by using       
    estimates of the instrument calibration and zero levels. The              
    calibration estimates cannot be improved in post processing due to        
    the onboard averaging. Any errors in the sensor zero levels in the        
    spin plane sensors will appear as harmonics of the spin period,           
    possibly modified by frequency folding effects associated with the        
    averaging windows. These effects can be removed in the RTS data in        
    post processing. The long average intervals of the opt/avg data           
    effectively removes these problems without need for post processing.      
    Improvements are made to the zero level correction of the spin            
    aligned sensor data for both RTS and opt/avg data in post                 
    processing.

    These data are stored in multiple data files in order to facilitate       
    use and electronic distribution. In general, data from a single           
    orbit is included in a data file. For some of the more data rich          
    orbits, further subdivision was provided. Data from the five              
    coordinate systems are stored in four separate files. The file            
    format for a particular coordinate system is independent of the data      
    acquisition interval. All data files from a given coordinate system       
    are identical in structure. All data files are ASCII, fixed field,        
    white space delimited tables. The following tables (4a-d) describe        
    the record structure of the various type of data files.

    The data are provided in five coordinate systems. Data are provided       
    in the spacecraft coordinate system in order to aid in the                
    interpretation of particle instrument data. The other coordinate          
    systems are provided for use in Jovian magnetospheric studies. The        
    Jupiter spin axis is defined to have a right ascension of 268.05          
    degrees and a declination of +64.49 degrees in the J2000 coordinate       
    system used by SPICE.

      spinning, and despins it using the rotor spin angle. For this           
      reason IRC coordinates are sometimes referred to as 'despun             
      spacecraft coordinates.' In this system, Z still points along the       
      spin axis opposite the HGA (or roughly anti-Earthward), X is            
      approximately parallel to the downward ecliptic normal, and Y           
      completes the right handed set (pointing roughly towards dawn).         
                                                                              
    System III [1965] Coordinates (SYS3)                                      
    ------------------------------------                                      
      SYS3 magnetic field vector components form the standard right           
      handed spherical triad (R, Theta, Phi) for a Jupiter centered           
      system. Namely, R is radial (along the line from the center of          
      Jupiter to the center of the spacecraft), and positive away from        
      Jupiter. Phi, the azimuthal component, is parallel to the               
      Jovigraphic equator (Omega x R) and positive in the direction of        
      corotation. Theta, the 'southward' component, completes the right       
      handed set.                                                             
                                                                              
      For SYS3 trajectory both east and west longitudes are provided.         
      West longitudes are related to east longitudes by to the                
      algorithm:                                                              
                                                                              
        west longitude = 360. - east longitude &#10094;degrees&#10095;                      
                                                                              
      West longitude is defined such that it appears to increase with         
      time for a stationary observer [DESSLER1983]. Note, however, that       
      R, latitude, and west longitude constitute a left handed set. The       
      SYS3 1965 prime meridian is the sub-Earth longitude of                  
      1965-01-01 00:00 UT. The spin rate (which was determined from the       
      rotation rate of the magnetic field) is 9 hrs 55 min 29.719 sec.        
      (See [DESSLER1983] for a discussion on Jovian longitude). R is the      
      radial (Jupiter's center to spacecraft center) distance. Latitude       
      is planetocentric.                                                      
                                                                              
    Jupiter Solar Equatorial Coordinates (JSE)                                
    ------------------------------------------                                
      JSE is a Jupiter centered cartesian coordinates system defined to       
      have it's Z-axis along the Jovian spin axis, positive in the            
      direction of angular momentum (northward). The X-Z plane is             
      contains the Sun so that the X-axis is the projection of the Sun        
      direction into Jupiter's equatorial plane (positive towards the         
      Sun). Y completes the right handed set and points duskward. This        
      coordinate system is sometimes called Jupiter centered, Sun             
      longitude fixed coordinates.

    ---------------------------------------                                   
      JSO is another Jupiter centered cartesian coordinate system. JSO        
      is the equivalent at Jupiter of GSE coordinates system at Earth.        
      In JSO coordinates, the X-axis points from Jupiter to the Sun. Z        
      is parallel to the upward normal to Jupiter's orbital plane. Y          
      completes the right handed set.

      Another Jupiter centered cartesian coordinate system, JSM is the        
      equivalent at Jupiter of GSM coordinates system at Earth. In this       
      coordinate system, the X-axis points from Jupiter to the Sun. The       
      secondary vector defining this coordinate system is the centered        
      magnetic dipole axis (M) which is defined to be tilted 9.6 degrees      
      from the Jovian spin axis towards 202 degrees SYS3 west longitude.      
      The X-Z plane is contains M. Y completes the right handed set. The      
      Y-Z plane rocks at the Jovian spin period about the Sun-Jupiter         
      line.

      Local hour angle is the angle (HA) between the observer's               
      (Galileo) sub-Jupiter meridian and the anti-sunward meridian,           
      measured in the Jovian equatorial plane in the direction of             
      planetary rotation. Local hour is the conversion of the local           
      hour angle into units of decimal hours using the conversion             
      factor of one hour to fifteen degrees of longitude. The following

      The magnetometer browse data set contains all of the survey data        
      that were returned from the instrument. However, there are              
      numerous gaps in coverage. Gaps can be caused by telemetry              
      outages, insufficient downlink or uplink, conjunctions, instrument      
      anomalies, spacecraft anomalies, commanding errors, etc. A              
      detailed gap listing including a description of the reason for the      
      gap is provided in a separate file with these data. Here is a list      
      of some of the larger or more common gaps.

      Other common causes of data gaps that are not related to                
      telemetry outages and anomaly gaps are listed below. Gaps may           
      have occurred throughout Jupiter Orbital Operations - whenever          
      the conditions which caused them existed.                               
                                                                              
        Gaps between consecutive opt/avg segments: Gaps of at least two       
        data vectors occurred between consecutive opt/avg data segments.      
        The first and last vector in every opt/avg segment are                
        underfiltered and have therefore been discarded. For the most         
        common data opt/avg rate, this results in a gap of ~1 hour.           
        These gaps may be larger than two vectors if there is any delay       
        between the MRO of the data in the buffer and the subsequent          
        opt/avg ON command.                                                   
                                                                              
        Snapshot corruption of RTS data: When snapshots (see                  
        [KIVELSONETAL1992] for more information) were taken the               
        addresses in which RTS data were averaged were overwritten with       
        snapshot data. Since snapshots were written to MAG memory in          
        reversed byte order, the result was a spike which persisted over      
        the course of few records due to the application of the filter.       
        Whenever possible RTS data corrupted by snapshots have been           
        replaced with sRTS data which were unaffected by snapshots. When      
        high-resolution data are not available, however, snapshots            
        result in a series of short (3-6 vector), regularly spaced gaps       
        in the RTS.                                                           
                                                                              
      The MAG data quality (size of error bars) varies with instrument        
      mode (digitization step size), sample rate, etc. The errors can         
      be broken down into three basic types: zero levels, gains, and          
      geometry.

      While sRTS data have been matched to the existing RTS data rates        
      they have not been generated using the same process. sRTS data          
      have not gone through the same recursive filter that was applied        
      to the regular RTS data. sRTS has been generated for the following      
      intervals:

      In general, the zero levels of the spin plane sensors have been         
      corrected to approximately 1/4 of the digitization step size            
      (i.e. if the step size is 8 nT, the zero level is good to 2 nT)         
      or 0.01 nT, which ever is larger. Spin plane sensor zero levels         
      are continuously adjusted by removing spin period averages in           
      the spinning reference frame. The spin aligned sensor zero levels       
      are monitored and adjusted at least once per orbit. The spin            
      aligned sensor zero levels are assumed to drift slowly and              
      linearly. The exception to this statement occurs at times               
      identified as 'offset anomalies' (see Table 7) where all three          
      sensors in a triad show large (2-3 nT) jumps in the zero levels.        
      These anomalies have been corrected in the processed data. In           
      general, the spin aligned sensor zero level is reliable to 0.1 nT.      
      Errors in zero level corrections appear as harmonics of the             
      spacecraft spin period as modified by the averaging window. The         
      nominal spacecraft spin period is 19 seconds and the most common        
      sample rates are 24 and 12 seconds.                                     
                                                                              
    Outboard Sensor Zero Levels                                               
    ---------------------------                                               
      Zero levels in the outboard sensor have proven to be strongly           
      temperature dependent. Offsets changed linearly with temperature        
      during the Earth-Jupiter Cruise mission phase where temperatures        
      went from 280-220 K. At Jupiter, where temperatures have been           
      lower than the instrument qualification ranges, offsets at              
      Jupiter have experienced occasional episodes of instability.            
      Offset changes may occur instantaneously or rapidly (over a             
      period of minutes). In some cases the offset has drifted back to        
      previous values over a period of days or months. In other cases         
      the offset has returned to it's original value sharply. In all          
      cases an attempt has been made to correct for these offset              
      in the processing so that the data appear continuous. Table 7           
      contains a listing of major offset anomalies.                           
                                                                              
    Gains                                                                     
    -----                                                                     
      The sensor gains were determined in ground calibration and              
      verified in-flight. In-flight verification included comparison          
      of Earth flyby data with model fields and monitoring for                
      sensor gain changes using the MAG internal calibration coils.           
      In general, the gains have remained stable throughout the               
      mission. There has been a slight change (linear) in the                 
      absolute gain levels associated with the sensor temperature.            
      Gains are believed to be known to substantially better than one         
      percent.                                                                
                                                                              
    Geometry                                                                  
    --------                                                                  
      Geometry corrections for sensor mounting and non-orthogonality          
      are applied through the sensor coupling matrix. Although the            
      sensor triads are rigid and are not believed to have changed            
      geometry through time, the triad itself is flipped periodically         
      to rotate the spin aligned sensor into the spin plane. Small            
      variations (&#10094;0.1 degree) in the triad mounting with respect to          
      the spacecraft coordinate system must be corrected after each           
      sensor flip. This is done by computing a new coupling matrix.           
                                                                              
      The data are despun by using the 'rotor spin angle' that is             
      broadcast on the spacecraft bus by the spacecraft attitude and          
      articulation control system (AACS). Despinning must be corrected        
      in ground processing to account for delays in the MAG instrument        
      electronics and filters. This task is accomplished by respinning        
      the data using the raw AACS data and then despinning using a            
      corrected spin angle. The total correction can be as large as           
      two degrees. After ground processing, the MAG data are                  
      geometrically correct to better than one degree, and probably           
      better than 0.1 degree.                                                 
                                                                              
    Optimal Averager AACS                                                     
    ---------------------                                                     
      Two of the rotor attitude angles supplied in the IRC data files,        
      Rotor Twist and Rotor Spin, are always flagged when the opt/avg         
      was being used to capture the data. The opt/avg produces                
      extremely low sampling rates (typically &#10095;32 min/sample).In              
      addition in the engineering stream the various rotor attitude           
      angles are sampled asynchronously both from each other and from         
      the MAG data. As a result any rotor attitude information provided       
      at the MAG sampling times must be interpolated. While the other         
      two angles vary only slowly, the twist and spin angles vary over        
      0-2 pi at the spacecraft spin period (~20 sec). Since the MAG           
      data produced by the opt/avg represent averages over many spin          
      periods it is not meaningful to assign specific twist or spin           
      angles to the data. It is also not possible to 're-spin' the            
      data, which is the purpose of providing Rotor Twist and Spin in         
      the first place.                                                        
                                                                              
    Slew Tests                                                                
    ----------                                                                
      Due to the continuing gyro electronics problems that were first         
      observed in E12, a series of 'slew tests' were implemented in           
      order to access gyro functioning. During these tests, because of        
      the potential for anomalous behavior by the gyros, the spacecraft       
      attitude is not known with any certainty. This poses problems for       
      both the B-field components and AACS. Opt/avg data, because of the      
      relatively short duration of the tests and the long averages of         
      the data, show no real effects from the corruption. The RTS data,       
      however, can show the effects very clearly. As a result the             
      B-field components have been flagged when a slew test was               
      performed with the instrument in RTS mode, and the components were      
      preserved when the instrument is in opt/avg mode. The components        
      were flagged in the RTS data even when no corruption was readily        
      apparent. The flagged data are available in the Galileo Jupiter         
      MAG raw data set.                                                       
                                                                              
      The following table gives the timing of the slew tests. The times       
      indicated correspond to the start and end of the group of commands      
      that constituted a slew test. The interval in which the B-field         
      components actually become corrupted was shorter than this. This        
      corrupted interval started approximately with the 'SLEW TEST'           
      and ended with the 'ENABLE SEQID,RESD HVEC' (see MAG EVENT TABLE).      
      Mode indicates whether the instrument was in RTS or OPT/AVG mode.       
      A value of 'N/A' indicates that the slew test occurs in a data          
      gap.

      Thruster flushes (RPM PROPEL LINES VENT) cause the loss of sector       
      (rotor twist) data onboard the spacecraft. This loss results in         
      the corruption of RTS and opt/avg data which depend upon sector         
      data for their onboard despinning. As a result RTS and opt/avg          
      data taken during thruster flushes should not be trusted.               
      Where they have been identified intervals of data affected by           
      this problem have been removed from this data set.

      Table 7 lists the offset anomalies that occurred over the course        
      of the mission. These anomalies typically consisted in an               
      instantaneous jump in the zero-level over all three sensors,            
      though in some cases there was a slower drift. The anomaly times        
      represent the times at which this jump was evident in the data.         
      In some instances, these events occcurred when the affected             
      magnetometer was not in use. In these cases the offsets had one         
      set of values when turned off, and a different set when turned on       
      some time later. The time given for these cases is the time at          
      which the magnetometer was turned back and the anomaly is               
      indicated as having happend 'before' that time.                         
                                                                              
      While zero-levels for the inboard magnetometer did change over          
      time, as evidenced by the below table the outboard magnetometer         
      proved much more unstable than the inboard (URLR was the mode           
      most commonly used in the outboard magnetometer). Because of its        
      instability, the outboard instrument it was not used between C10        
      and G29. Had it been used additional anomalies may well have been       
      observed in this time period.

      Jupiter Orbital Insertion (JOI):                                        
                                                                              
      Prior to the JOI burn the spacecraft spin rate was increased in         
      order to make it more stable for the firing of the main engine.         
      In addition there was no high-resolution AACS through this              
      interval. As a result of the variable spin rate and lack of             
      high-resolution AACS it was not possible despin the MAG data. As        
      a result only the magnetic-field magnitude is provided.                 
                                                                              
      Callisto 3 Orbit:                                                       
                                                                              
      The data from the inboard sensor, low field, flip right mode            
      acquired during the third orbit was irrecoverably corrupted.            
      Data from this orbit should be used with caution, particularly          
      in applications where the field orientation needs to be known           
      to better than a few degrees. At the beginning of the orbit,            
      the inboard sensor was commanded to flip right. We believe that         
      when this flip occurred, the sensor triad failed to lock into           
      place properly. As a result, the sensor triad appears to                
      'jiggle' resulting in an unstable geometry. The extent of this          
      jiggle is unknown but is believed to be on the order of a degree        
      or so. One of the impacts of the unstable sensor geometry is that       
      the sensor offsets, which are a combination of spacecraft fields        
      and sensor zero levels, vary on short time scales. In order to          
      reduce the spin harmonics attributable to offsets in this orbit,        
      the RTS data have been averaged using a 120 second window on            
      24 second centers.                                                      
                                                                              
      Callisto 9 and 10 Orbit Opt/Avg:                                        
                                                                              
      In orbits C9 and C10 the magnetometer was commanded into opt/avg        
      mode without deselecting the instrument from RTS. As a result the       
      Command and Data Subsystem (CDS) overwrote the opt/avg rate             
      filter constant stored in MAG memory with a RTS rate filter             
      constant. This resulted in the data being under filtered relative       
      to the data sample rate. This under filtering shows up as               
      spin-tone in the spinning sensors in spacecraft coordinates. In         
      order to eliminate the spin-tone the raw data has been averaged         
      (two point averages on one point centers). Averaging has been           
      performed on the following intervals:

      Europa 17 MAG and AACS instability:                                     
                                                                              
      Between 1998-09-26T15:46:24 and 1998-09-26T16:42:01 the AACS data       
      are unstable. Apparently, some form of AACS calibration was             
      occurring. During this period, the magnetometer spin plane              
      components appear to slowly rotate and then jump back to a              
      correct orientation. This problem occurred on the spacecraft and        
      has not been corrected in the ground system processing.

      Due to a spacecraft anomaly AACS data from 1999-01-31 16:02:06 -        
      1999-02-01 01:49:37 (which were being stored in the Multi User          
      Buffer) were never returned. The MAG data from this interval,           
      however, were written to tape and returned later. Recovering the        
      lost AACS - specifically the rotor right-ascension (RA), and            
      declination (DEC) - was complicated by two Science Instrument           
      Turns (SITURN's) which occurred in the missing interval. In             
      between the SITURN's, RA and DEC were interpolated by the               
      following means:                                                        
                                                                              
        1/31 16:02:06 to 18:01:28     - set to last known value               
        1/31 18:01:28 to 18:26        - linearly interpolated                 
        1/31 18:26    to 19:31:27     - assumed constant between              
          SITURN's and determined by examination                              
        1/31 19:31:27 to 19:49        - linearly interpolated                 
        1/31 19:49    to 2/1 01:49:37 - set to next known value (taken        
          from high-res. data, the E19-EUR recording)

      perijove recordings (C21-PJOV, C22-PJOV, and C23-PJOV) were             
      seriously corrupted. While similar problems are not evident in          
      the RTS and opt/avg data, care should be taken in the use of            
      these lower rate data as well. For Orbit 23 it was necessary to         
      interpolate the rotor twist and spin angles of the intervals:           
      1999-09-17 05:26:41 to 06:08:30 and 1999-09-27 16:06:58 to              
      16:28:53.                                                               
                                                                              
      Io 25 Data Gaps Due to Corruption by Snapshots:                         
                                                                              
      Following recovery from spacecraft safing, MAG was inadvertently        
      left in snapshot mode. As a result there are numerous short gaps        
      where the RTS data were corrupted by snapshots, and a large gap         
      where the OPT/AVG data were overwritten. This problem affects           
      the interval 1999-11-26 04:32 to 1999-11-29 00:54.                      
                                                                              
      Europa 26 Data Rate Anomaly:                                            
                                                                              
      The packet headers for the data from the time interval                  
      2000-01-01 23:30:00.000 to 2000-01-03 14:08:39.742 indicated that       
      the data were sampled at 18 minor frames (mf) or 12 seconds             
      sampling resolution. This data rate matched the MAG RTS format          
      reported in the sequence (format E). In the original 12 second          
      data there were a series of systematic gaps. The end of each gap        
      occurred where the packet of MAG data included a time tag. This         
      would be the case if an incorrect sampling rate were applied to         
      the data in packets where no time tag is given, then the data           
      were to jump forward to the correct time when a time tag was            
      given. Accordingly the data in this interval were re-time tagged        
      at 36 mf (24 second) samples. This done the data became                 
      continuous across what were previously gaps -- both in time (the        
      data are evenly sampled), and data value (the data contain no           
      steps). The reason for this discrepancy was unknown.                    
                                                                              
      Io 33 Offset Instability:                                               
                                                                              
      The spin-plane offsets in the outboard sensor (URLR mode) were          
      highly unstable for the RTS data. This includes the following           
      intervals:                                                              
                                                                              
        2002-01-22 20:30 - 2002-01-31 13:00                                   
        2002-10-22 00:00 - 2002-10-31 12:30                                   
                                                                              
      While an attempt was made to correct the offsets, some problems         
      may still exist (see 'Zero Levels'). Additionally, the zero level       
      instability may indicate that the sensor was about to fail. For         
      both of these reasons, the data from these two intervals should         
      be treated with some suspicion.                                         
                                                                              
      Io 33 opt/avg data timing:                                              
                                                                              
      The timing of the opt/avg data in the interval 2002-Sep-28 13:00        
      to 2002-Oct-02 23:15 are somewhat questionable and the data should      
      be treated with some caution. According to the planned sequence,        
      the data collected after the opt/avg on command given at                
      2002-09-28 12:05, were due to be read out with the MRO scheduled        
      for 2002-10-02 18:00. However, due to the spacecraft safing that        
      occurred 2002-10-02 03:38 the MRO was not executed. Since the           
      spacecraft was still safed, the subsequent opt/avg on command           
      (2002-10-02 19:05) was also not executed and the data were not          
      overwritten. Thus when the MRO commanded at 2002-10-07 10:00 was        
      executed the data returned appear to have been from the opt/avg at      
      2002-09-28 12:05 -- and not from the opt/avg at 2002-10-02 19:05        
      as originally planned. The data in this interval have been timed        
      according to this assumed sequence of events.                           
                                                                              
      Amalthea 34 data coverage:                                              
                                                                              
      Spacecraft operations ended on 2003-01-15. As a result there is a       
      large gap in coverage from about that time until 2003-09-21 when        
      operations resumed briefly to record the spacecraft's plunge into       
      the Jovian atmosphere. Between these two times an occasional            
      single (8 hour) pass of data was provided as a monitor of               
      instrument health. However, these monitoring data are not included      
      as part of this data set. The reasons for omitting these data are       
      that their sporatic nature limits their usefulness, and a lack of       
      AACS data prevents them from being fully processed. These               
      monitoring data are included in the Galileo at Jupiter MAG raw          
      data set.                                                               
                                                                              
      Jupter 35 AACS:                                                         
                                                                              
      The AACS returned in J35 had Earth Receive Times (ERTs) on              
      2003-09-21, but Spacecraft Event Times (SCETs) on 2003-01-22. In        
      processing the J35 data it was assumed that the ERTs were correct       
      and that the SCETs were incorrect, meaning that the values of RA        
      and DEC were approximately correct. Due to the difficulty of            
      precisely determining the correct timing of the AACS data, the          
      RA, DEC, and rotor spin delta were set to the most common values        
      for the interval, and the rotor spin angle, and rotor twist angle       
      were calculated from them.

     2       opt/avg data timing was corrected: a previous error in           
             the time tagging of the opt/avg data resulted in that            
             data being shifted earlier in time by one averager step.         
     3       JSO coordinates were added (and included with JSM

             filter response time applied to the 'SAMPLE TIME' was            
             added to the SYS3, JSE, and JSO/JSM coordinate data              
             files; SYS3 coordinate file was modified to include both
