      magnetometer data from the Low Field Magnetometer (LFM)

      Voyager 2 SEDR and provided by the Voyager MAG Team, are part           
      of the data set VG2-J-POS-6-SUMM-S3COORDS-V1.1. The position

      The data set consists of the following columns: 1) UT of the            
      sample in the format yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ, 2-4) spacecraft          
      clock (m65536, mod60, fds-line), 5) magnetometer id (1 = LFM,           
      2 = HFM), 6) Br radial (Jupiter to spacecraft) B-field                  
      component, 7) Btheta (North/South system III B-field                    
      component, positive southward), 8) Bphi (azimuthal system III           
      B-field component, positive eastward), 9) Bmag (magnitude of            
      the averaged components), 10) avg_Bmag (average of the                  
      magnetic field magnitudes), 11) delta (latitude =                       
      arcsin(Btheta/Bmag)), 12) lambda (longitude = 180. -                    
      atan(Bphi/-Br)), 13-15) rms vectors, 16) sc_r (Jupiter to               
      spacecraft range), 17) sc_lat (jovicentric latitude, positive           
      northward), 18) sc_lon (jovicentric east longitude, system III          
      1965) 19) npts (number of points in average), 20) data flag -           
      a flag value that indicates either software error or                    
      spacecraft hardware interference reduced confidence in this             
      record (flag value of 1 is bad, 0 is good or unchecked). All            
      magnetic field observations are measured in nanoTesla. The              
      coordinate system for this data set is System (1965) III. All           
      of the magnetic field data are calibrated (see the instrument           
      calibration description for more details). The Jupiter System           
      III coordinate system is defined in [DESSLER1983] and the               
      reference documents for this data set are: [NESSETAL1979A],             
      [LEPPINGETAL1981], [CONNERNEYETAL1981], [BEHANNONETAL1981].

      This data set contains some data gaps and spikes. The data set          
      does contain a flag value which has been provided by the PI             
      (Norman Ness) that indicates whether or not a particular                
      record has been contaminated by software error or by                    
      spacecraft interference (a flag value of 1 indicates a bad              
      value, 0 indicates that the record has either not been                  
      evaluated or is good). Some records that are obviously                  
      contaminated have not been flagged. The hourly summary data             
      will show a contamination code and data quality code of 2 when          
      data in the hour have not been flagged but are obviously in             
      error and a contamination code of 1 when the hour contains              
      flagged records."
