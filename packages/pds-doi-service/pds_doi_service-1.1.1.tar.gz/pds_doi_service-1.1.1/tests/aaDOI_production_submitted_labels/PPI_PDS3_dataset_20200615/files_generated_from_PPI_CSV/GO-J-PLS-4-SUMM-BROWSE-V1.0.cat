    The browse data files are obtained by averaging data for one energy       
    spectrum from the reduced data record (RDR) files. The PLS instrument     
    obtains an energy spectrum in either one spacecraft rotation (LPW) or     
    two spacecraft rotations (RTS).  The time tag is set to the               
    spacecraft clock (SCLK) value at the start of the average.  Energy        
    averaging is done by adding together all available measurements           
    within each energy band and dividing by the number of samples.

    These data are provided so that users can get a quick look into the       
    data acquired by the PLS instrument. They are not intended for            
    detailed analysis. Lots of PLS data can be quickly scanned using          
    these data in order to identify regions of potential interest. Once       
    such a region is identified, the user is strongly encouraged to use       
    the RDR data set (GO-J-PLS-2-RDR-RAWCOUNTS-V1.0) in their analysis.

    All data that were received on the ground from the PLS instrument         
    after December 1995 are included in this data set. This data set          
    contains gaps in coverage. Many of these gaps were planned                
    (insufficient telemetry coverage to provide continuous data) and          
    others were not (telemetry dropouts, station outages, etc.). "
