      This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric                
      field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver               
      spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian

      frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated                
      with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of               
      the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete

      Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                   
                                                                              
      The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text             
      file named SA_CL.TAB (for Voyager-1). This provides                     
      information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output            
      of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna           
      voltages for each frequency channel. Following is a brief               
      description of these files and a tutorial in their                      
      application.                                                            
                                                                              
      Descriptive headers have been removed from the calibration              
      table file. The columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02,             
      ICHAN03, ICHAN04, ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                        
                                                                              
      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by          
      the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16          
      frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer. Each line              
      contains calibrations for successive data number values                 
      ranging from 0 through 255. (Data number 0 actually represents          
      the lack of data since the baseline noise values for each               
      channel are all above that.)                                            
                                                                              
      A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a           
      data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to              
      obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and              
      frequency channel. For example, the following VAX FORTRAN code          
      may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1 PWS:              
                                                                              
        real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                 
        open ( unit=10, file='SA_CL.TAB', status='old' )                      
                                                                              
        do i=0,255                                                            
          read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                          
        end do                                                                
        close (10)                                                            
                                                                              
      Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency            
      channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage             
      would be given by the following array reference:                        
                                                                              
        volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                              
                                                                              
      This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by             
      dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.             
      That is:                                                                
                                                                              
        efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                       
                                                                              
      Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square           
      of the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth          
      of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                         
                                                                              
        specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                
                                                                              
      Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral            
      density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                         
                                                                              
        pwrflux = ((cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan))/376.73          
                                                                              
      Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                 
      efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration             
      table directly.                                                         
                                                                              
      The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum

      This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data             
      within the interval of time covered. The data set has been              
      cleaned as well as possible for periodic noise spikes due to a          
      stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated grid                
      within the PLS. The 'bad' points remain in the data set as              
      negative numbers with the same absolute value as the original           
      data point so that the point can be skipped in normal data              
      processing by testing for negative values or recovered for              
      special inspection by converting the sign back to a positive            
      one. Other possible sources of noise which have not been                
      eliminated include a nearly continuous tone at about 311 Hz             
      after closest approach due to interference from the gyros and           
      random intense spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz due to the             
      operation of attitude control thrusters. The data between 0040          
      and 0155 spacecraft event time on July 10 1979 is heavily               
      contaminated by thruster activity associated with a trajectory          
      correction maneuver. Other randomly occurring spikes or time            
      periods of intense spikes over the entire frequency range are           
      indicative of telemetry errors. No attempt has been made to             
      remove spikes since some could be valid data, i.e. real bursts          
      of wave activity. The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes                      
      contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument,                   
      depending on that instrument's mode. This interference is at a          
      relatively constant level.
