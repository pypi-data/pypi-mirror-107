    This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from the        
    Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver waveform receiver obtained during          
    the Neptune encounter. The waveforms are collections of 4-bit             
    samples of the electric field measured by the dipole electric antenna     
    at a rate of 28,800 samples per second.  1600 samples are collected       
    in 55.56 msec followed by a 4.44-msec gap. Each 60-msec interval          
    constitutes a line of waveform samples. The data set includes about 271   
    frames of waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, each.  The      
    telemetry format for the waveform data is identical to that for           
    images, hence the use of line and frame as constructs in describing       
    the form of the data.  The waveform is sampled through a bandpass         
    filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  The 4-bit samples             
    provide sixteen digital values of the electric field with a               
    linear amplitude scale, but the amplitude scale is arbitrary              
    because of the automatic gain control used in the waveform                
    receiver.  The instantaneous dynamic range afforded by the 4              
    bit samples is about 23 db, but the automatic gain control allows         
    the dominant signal in the passband to be set at the optimum              
    level to fit within the instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain       
    control, the overall dynamic range of the waveform receiver               
    is about 100 db.  The automatic gain control gain setting is not          
    returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration           
    for the data.  However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived        
    by Fourier transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by          
    the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be                
    obtained in most cases.  The data may be plotted in raw form to           
    show the actual waveform; this is useful for studying events such         
    as dust impacts on the spacecraft.  But the normal method of              
    analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier transforming the samples        
    from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.       
    By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-          
    time spectrogram can be produced.

      Plasma wave waveform: A plasma wave waveform is a time series of        
      measurements of the electric or magnetic field component of the         
      wave spectrum taken through a broadband filter.  The temporal           
      sample rate is normally such that samples are made at more than         
      twice the analysis filter bandwidth.  A typical waveform will           
      consist of the order of 1000 contiguous samples of between 4 and        
      12 bits each.  For a 10-kHz analysis bandwidth, the sample rate         
      would normally be approximately 25 kHz or 25,000 samples/second.        
      Once received, the waveforms are typically Fourier transformed in       
      order to provide an amplitude versus frequency spectrum across          
      the analysis bandwidth.  The sample rate, then, is required to be       
      at least a factor of two greater than the filter bandwidth in           
      order to avoid aliasing in the transformed spectrum.  The spectra       
      can be stacked side-by-side in time to build a frequency-time           
      spectrogram (that is, amplitude as a function of time and               
      frequency) in order to identify the temporal and spectral               
      variations in the wave spectrum.  Alternately, the untransformed        
      time series can be used to study the details of the waveform.           
      This has been useful for measuring small-scale structures in the        
      plasma and for identifying the signature of micron-sized dust           
      impact on the spacecraft.

  =========================                                                   
    This data set includes all available waveform receiver data obtained      
    during the Neptune encounter.  There has been no attempt                  
    to clean various interference signals from the data.  Most of these       
    can normally be easily seen in frequency-time spectrograms as             
    narrowband, fixed-frequency tones.  The most common include narrow-       
    band tones at 2.4 and 4.8 kHz which are power supply harmonics.           
    There is sometimes a tone near 1.7 kHz which is associated with           
    the operation of the spacecraft gyros.  The spacecraft tape               
    recorder results in a rather intense band in the frequency range          
    of a few hundred Hz.  There are few times when the data in this           
    frequency range can be used.  However, there are times when the           
    real signals in this frequency range can exceed the intensity of          
    the interference sufficiently so that the frequency range near            
    a few hundred Hz can be used.  Use of the spectrum analyzer data          
    can be of use to determine when these time periods occur.  The            
    stepper motor of the LECP instrument also interferes in the               
    frequency range of a few hundred Hz, but for periods of a few             
    seconds.                                                                  
                                                                              
    The LECP interference is very intense and captures the automatic          
    gain control so that real signals, even where there is no                 
    interference, will appear to decrease in amplitude until the LECP         
    interference fades in amplitude.  The PLS instrument periodically         
    interferes at 400 Hz and odd harmonics because of a 400-Hz square         
    wave used to modulate a grid in the detector.  The PLS interference       
    lasts for several seconds and ends abruptly.  Telemetry errors            
    result in a fairly graceful degradation of the waveform data.             
    Assuming the telemetry errors are randomly occurring bursts, they         
    typically appear as an enhanced background level in the spectrum.         
    Since the bursts are short, their Fourier transform is a broadband        
    spectrum. When looking for relatively narrowband features or              
    features with distinct frequency-time characteristics, the result         
    of the bursts simply reduce the signal-to-noise in the spectrum.          
    One way of reducing the effect of burst telemetry errors is to pass       
    the waveform data through a low-pass filter to despike it, prior to       
    running the Fourier transform.  The waveform data is not subject          
    to the negative effects of the failure in the Voyager 2 Flight            
    Data System which reduces the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer        
    and affects the calibration above 1 kHz.  In fact, use of the 1 -         
    12 kHz waveform data is an effective way of avoiding the problems         
    with the spectrum analyzer data in this frequency range.

         deleting too many data points. Remaining LECP contamination          
         will appear as periodic bursts of noise in one or more               
         channels in the range 100 Hertz to about 1 kiloHertz.
