  Data Set Overview                                                           
  =================                                                           
                                                                              
    The Lunar Prospector spacecraft trajectory data set consists of           
    spacecraft position determinations in numerous coordinate systems         
    at one minute intervals. The data set also contains the spacecraft        
    velocity as a function of time.  This data set is derived by using        
    the spacecraft position data set from the Lunar Prospector level          
    zero data archive (LP-L-6-POSITION-V1.0). The SPICE SPK kernel            
    LP_EPHEM.TSP that is included on the archive volume provides              
    ephemeris data for the Sun, Earth, and Moon. These data are combined      
    with the Lunar Prospector location relative to the Moon in order          
    to generate trajectory data that will facilitate the analysis of          
    both the magnetometer and the electron reflectometer data sets.           
                                                                              
    Each file in the spacecraft trajectory data set covers one month of       
    time.                                                                     
                                                                              
  Science Objectives                                                          
  ==================                                                          
                                                                              
    The Lunar Prospector science objectives relevant to this data set are     
    to map the Moon's surface composition and its magnetic field, and to      
    determine the frequency and location of gas release events.  A            
    special emphasis of the science objectives is to search for polar         
    water ice deposits [BINDERETAL1998].  The spacecraft position data        
    are used to locate where on the Moon science data were acquired.          
                                                                              
  Coordinate Systems                                                          
  ==================                                                          
                                                                              
    Selenographic: These data are a repeat of the values generated by         
    the Goddard Flight Dynamics Analysis Branch for the level zero data.      
    The selenographic coordinate system provided is an east longitude         
    system where the prime meridian is defined in [DAVIESETAL1994]. A         
    negligible amount of flattening (1x10**-30) is used for the Moon.         
    Thus, selenographic latitude is nearly equal to selenocentric             
    latitude with almost no error.  The mean radius and GM of the Moon        
    used to generate this data set are 1738 km and 4902.8014 km**3/s**2,      
    respectively. Both spherical (SG) and Cartesian (SEL) representations     
    of the selenographic coordinate system are provided. In the Cartesian     
    representation, the Z-axis is aligned with the lunar spin axis,           
    positive in the direction of angular momentum. The X-axis lies in         
    the equatorial plane and points in the direction of the prime             
    meridian. Y completes the right-handed set.                               
                                                                              
    Selenocentric Solar Ecliptic (SSE): The SSE coordinate system has         
    its X-axis along the instantaneous Moon-Sun line, positive towards        
    the Sun. The Z-axis is parallel to the upward normal to the Earth's       
    ecliptic plane, and Y completes the right-handed set. Distances are       
    measured from the lunar center of mass and are reported in units          
    of kilometers.                                                            
                                                                              
    Geocentric Solar Ecliptic (GSE): The GSE coordinate system has            
    its X-axis along the instantaneous Earth-Sun line, positive towards       
    the Sun. The Z-axis is parallel to the upward normal to the Earth's       
    ecliptic plane, and Y completes the right-handed set. Distances are       
    measured from the Earth center of mass and are reported in units          
    of Earth radii where 1 Re = 6372 km.                                      
                                                                              
    Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric (GSM): The GSM coordinate system has      
    its X-axis along the instantaneous Earth-Sun line, positive towards       
    the Sun (same as GSE X-axis!). The X-Z plane is defined to contain        
    the the Earth's dipole (passes through 78.565 deg North, 69.761 deg       
    West). Y completes the right-handed set. Distances are measured from      
    the Earth center of mass and are reported in units of Earth radii         
    where 1 Re = 6372 km.                                                     
                                                                              
    Definitions of the GSE and GSM coordinate systems come from               
    [RUSSELL1971]. The Earth's dipole location used in the GSM coordinate     
    system definition is based on the 1970 IGRF model as stated in that       
    reference."

    Error bars are not provided with the original spacecraft position         
    data set. All values in this data set are reported to the nearest
