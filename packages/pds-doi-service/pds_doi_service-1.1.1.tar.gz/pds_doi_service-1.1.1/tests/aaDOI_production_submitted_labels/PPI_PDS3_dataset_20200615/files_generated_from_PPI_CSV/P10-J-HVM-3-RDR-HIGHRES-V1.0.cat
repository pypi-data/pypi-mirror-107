      There are some timing (longitude) issues with these data when compared 
      to data at lower sample rates.  There were known problems with the     
      spacecraft attitude and articulation subsystem on the spacecraft. When 
      the data were originally reduced and archived, the MAG team corrected  
      the low resolution data and submitted them to the NSSDC. These data    
      were processed and delivered to the PDS many years later and made use  
      of the SPICE kernels that are available for the spacecraft.  The       
      resulting computations of position differ slightly from the originally 
      computed and corrected values."
