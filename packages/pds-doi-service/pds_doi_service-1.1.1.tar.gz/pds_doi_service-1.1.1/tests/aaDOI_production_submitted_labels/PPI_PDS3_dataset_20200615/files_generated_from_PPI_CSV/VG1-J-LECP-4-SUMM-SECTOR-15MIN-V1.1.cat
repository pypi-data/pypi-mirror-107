      This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set             
      (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-LECP-4-15MIN) previously archived with             
      the PDS.  Data records from the version 1.0 data set provided           
      data for each of 8 sectors, plus the average for all sectors            
      in a separate record for each channel.  This resulted in 9              
      repeated times per channel.  Data records for the version 1.1           
      data set provide all data for a given channel and time period           
      (8 sectors, plus the average for all sectors) in a single               
      record.  Other changes to this version include upgrading of             
      the associated labels and templates to PDS version 3.2                  
      compliance, modification of the time formats and flag values.

    --------------------                                                      
      This data set consists of resampled data from the Low Energy            
      Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 1 while the               
      spacecraft was in the vicinity of Jupiter.  This instrument             
      measures the intensities of in-situ charged particles (&#10095;26 keV          
      electrons and &#10095;30 keV ions) with various levels of                      
      discrimination based on energy, mass species, and angular               
      arrival direction.  A subset of almost 100 LECP channels are            
      included with this data set.  The LECP data are globally                
      calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and they are time         
      averaged to about 15 minute time intervals with the exact               
      beginning and ending times for those intervals matching the             
      LECP instrumental cycle periods (the angular scanning periods).         
      The LECP instrument has a rotating head for obtaining angular           
      anisotropy measurements of the medium energy charged particles          
      that it measures.  The cycle time for the rotation is variable,         
      but during encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes.              
      Thus, the full angular anisotropy information is preserved with         
      this data.  The data is in the form of 'rate' data which has            
      not been converted to the usual physical units.  The reason is          
      that such a conversion would depend on uncertain determinations         
      such as the mass species of the particles and the level of              
      background.  Both mass species and background are generally             
      determined from context during the study of particular regions.         
      To convert 'rate' to 'intensity' for a particular channel one           
      performs the following tasks: 1) Decide on the level of                 
      background contamination and subtract that off the given rate           
      level.  Background is to be determined from context and from            
      making use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 mm Al shield             
      covering it).  2) Divide the background corrected rate by the           
      channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of the              
      channel.  The geometric factor is found in entry                        
      'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_FACTOR' as associated with each channel              
      'CHANNEL_ID'.  To determine the energy bandpass, one must judge         
      the mass species of the of the detected particles (for ions but         
      not for electrons).  The energy band passes are given in                
      entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and                              
      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY', and are         
      given in the form 'energy/nucleon'.  For channels that begin            
      their names with the designations 'CH' these bandpasses can be          
      used on mass species that are accepted into that channel (see           
      entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' AND                              
      'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which            
      give the minimum and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these                
      entries are blank for electron channels).  For other channels           
      the given bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value                  
      accepted.  The and passes for other 'Z' values are not all              
      known, but some are given in the literature (e.g.                       
      [KRIMIGISETAL1979A]).  The final product of these instructions          
      will be the particle intensity with the units: counts/(cm^2 str         
      sec keV).

  Confidence Level Overview                                                   
  =========================                                                   
    At all times during this planetary encounter there exist data             
    in this data set that can be rated with the highest confidence            
    level.  However, some of the channels of data are contaminated            
    by various kinds and various levels of contaminations.  It is             
    therefore imperative, in using this data set, that the                    
    contamination tables within the catalog be examined.  Also, not           
    all kinds of contamination have been fully documented.  When in           
    doubt the data supplier must be contacted.                                
                                                                              
    Some channels are subject to serious contaminations, and many             
    of these contaminations cannot be removed except with a region-           
    by-region analysis, which has not been done for this data.                
    Thus, to use this data it is absolutely vital that the                    
    contamination types ('CONTAMINATION_ID' , 'CONTAMINATION_DESC')           
    and the levels of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID'                        
    corresponding to the definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be                  
    carefully examined for all regions of study.  A dead time                 
    correction procedure has been applied in an attempt to correct            
    the linear effects of detector overdrive (pulse-pileup).  This            
    procedure does not fix severely overdriven detectors.  A                  
    procedure is available for correcting Voyager 2 LECP electron             
    contamination of low energy ion channels, but its effectiveness           
    has been evaluated only for the Uranus data set.  Thus,                   
    corrections have been applied only to the Uranus data set.                
                                                                              
    Also included with this data are one standard deviation                   
    statistical uncertainties for the directional data (sectors 1             
    through 8 and an average) expressed as a percent. Unknown values are      
    generally coded as such, however in some instances the value              
    will read 'zero' when its status is unknown.

    for the period covered in the data files.  This file provides

          that the measurement cannot be retrieved                            
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Data Quality Desc                                                         
    -----------------                                                         
      1: Ion channels penetrating background. All ion channels are            
         subject to background due to high energy particles that              
         penetrate detector shielding. Channels that are the result           
         of 'particle multiple parameters' measurements are less              
         subject to such contamination (channels 'CH__'). A crude             
         quality parameter has been derived from the ratio of the             
         shielded and unshielded 53 to 85 keV 'pl01' ion channel.             
         All other channels must be judged independently from                 
         context and from a corresponding ratio. No corrections               
         have been applied.                                                   
                                                                              
      2: Solar UV. When the lowest energy ion and electron                    
         detectors (electron detector less affected) face the sun             
         (sector 1) substantial background counts can occur in the            
         lowest (pl01) and (somewhat) next to lowest (pl02) ion               
         channels. A very crude quality parameter is derived from             
         the ratio of the sun-facing and adjacent sector for the              
         pl01 channel. This parameter should not be accepted as               
         the last word but should be only used for guidance, and it           
         can be misleading. Electrons must be judged separately. No           
         corrections have been applied.                                       
                                                                              
      3: Ion channel electron contamination. The lowest energy ion            
         channels (pl01 through pl05) are subject to contamination            
         from &#10095; 400 keV electrons which penetrate the magnetic                
         shielding. This condition is well diagnosed on Voyager 2             
         but not on Voyager 1. Context, corresponding Voyager 2               
         measurements, and the correlation between moderate energy            
         electron channels and these ion channels must be use to              
         diagnose this condition for Voyager 1. A correction has              
         been applied only to the Voyager 2 Uranus data.                      
                                                                              
      4: Ion detector overdrive. If the fluxes striking a detector            
         is too high, the output of that detector becomes anomalous           
         due to pulse pileup (linear effects) and baseline                    
         restoration (non-linear effects) problems. All detectors             
         are subject to possible problems. A crude quality                    
         parameter has been derived based on the total rate                   
         striking the detector that measures the lowest energy ions           
         (pl01-pl08). Pl01-5 are the channels most strongly affected,         
         with the greatest effects occurring for the lowest energy            
         channels. A dead-time correction procedure has been applied          
         to the data to help alleviate the less severe problems.              
                                                                              
      5: Detector noise. The detector/electronics noise for the               
         lowest energy detectors (ions in particular) is not too              
         far below the lowest energy discrimination levels. That              
         noise can appear as background counts in the lowest energy           
         channels if the detector noise increases as a result of              
         the detector being overdriven, etc. The lowest                       
         discrimination can be adjusted by ground command to help             
         alleviate this problem. A crude quality parameter has been           
         derived based on reasonable/unreasonable ratios of the ion           
         channels pl01 and pl02. This parameter should be used only           
         as a rough guide and can be misleading. No correction has            
         been applied.                                                        
                                                                              
      6: Electron channels penetrating background. All electron               
         channels are subject to background due to high energy                
         particles that penetrate detector shielding. A crude                 
         quality parameter has been derived based on the ratio of             
         the shielded and unshielded 37 to 70 keV 'eb02' electron             
         channel. All other channels must be judged independently             
         from context and from a corresponding ratio. No correction           
         has been applied.                                                    
                                                                              
      7: Electron detector overdrive. If the fluxes striking a                
         detector is too high, the output of that detector becomes            
         anomalous due to pulse pileup (linear effects) and                   
         baseline restoration (non-linear effects) problems. All              
         detectors are subject to possible problems. A crude                  
         quality parameter has been derived based on the total rate           
         striking the detector that measures the lowest energy                
         electrons (eb01-eb05). The greatest effects occur for the            
         lowest energy channels. A dead-time correction procedure             
         has been applied to the data to help alleviate less severe           
         problems.                                                            
                                                                              
      8: Miscellaneous bad data spikes. There are 'spikes' in the             
         data processed for this instrument due to telemetry                  
         problems and other processing problems. Their are routines           
         to eliminate these spikes, however, sometimes real events            
         (fast changing) are also eliminated. We have chosen to               
         leave the spikes in and to eliminate them when needed from           
         context. "
