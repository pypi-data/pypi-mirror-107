     In computing RNH1,TH1 we used the 3rd to 7th channels above 
     the breakpoint energy EB1 and subtracted the cold component 
     FC from FE (observed) before doing the fit. In reality this 
     fit was done iteratively between the cold and hot component 
     fits (FC=FE-FH and FH=FE-FC etc.). A similar approach was   
     used in computing RNH3,TH3 for which a Maxwellian fit was   
     done to those channels above EB2. The parameters RNH2,TH2   
     were fit to the upper 5 (3 MIN) channels (generally above   
     EB2). This fit was primarily done to allow proper           
     estimation of FE to the high energy portion of the          
     spectrum. In many cases there are not sufficient points to  
     compute RNH3,TH3 AND RNH2,TH2 do provide a fair             
     representation of the spectrum. If RNH1=RNH2=RNH3 then you  
     should not use the 2nd and 3rd fit parameters. Values of    
     1.E32 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained     
     from the data using the standard analysis technique.        
     Additional information about this dataset and the           
     instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this 
     catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be    
     found in Sittler et al. (1987) and a complete instrument    
     description can be found in Bridge (1977)."

     This data set provides an estimate of the electron          
     parameters in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV). The        
     thermal electron parameters may be underestimated in some   
     regions due to negative spacecraft charging which is not    
     corrected for. Electron parameters may also be unreliable   
     between 1736 and 1854 SCET on Jan 24 where electron         
     temperatures are below the instrument energy threshold.     
     Between 1920 and 2150 SCET on Jan 24 The spacecraft had a   
     large (several hundred volt) negative potential, so         
     electron parameters in this region should also be treated   
     with caution. The instrument threshold for detecting        
     electrons is a density of about 0.001 CM-3. At times when   
     the density is near this value all derived parameters are   
     suspect. From 1621 to 1649 on Jan. 24 sunlight created an   
     artificial signal so this data should be discarded. The     
     LECP stepper motor is also creates a spurious signal in the 
     PLS detector; times when this occurs are flagged.
