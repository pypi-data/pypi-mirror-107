Overview:

Magnetometer data records are time-ordered series of magnetic vector          
measurements. Each record consists of a time tag followed by six              
scalar values representing the magnetic field vector, measured in             
nanoteslas, in two different coordinate systems: selenocentric solar          
ecliptic (SSE) and body-fixed selenographic (SEL), followed by the rms        
deviation of the field magnitude, which is independent of the                 
coordinate system.  The spacecraft position is given in both of the           
above coordinate systems.  These data are obtained continuously at 9          
Hz and are averaged in 5-second intervals for this data archive.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
Parameters:

Magnetic field data are provided in units of nanotesla (nT).                  
                                                                              
                                                                              
Processing:                                                                   
==========                                                                    
                                                                              
Magnetic field data are sampled onboard at 18 Hz and averaged to 9 Hz         
before being placed into telemetry. In order to cover a very large            
dynamic range with 12-bit values, the full range of the instrument is         
divided into 8 sub-ranges. Range changing is performed dynamically            
onboard based on the ambient field strength. The first step in the            
processing is to extract the data from telemetry and form time-tagged         
magnetic field vectors.  Then, occasional data spikes due to range            
changes or bad telemetry are flagged; these data points are not used in       
the offset determination.  The instrumental offsets for Bx and By are         
calculated simultaneously for 1 minute data windows using a technique         
developed by M. Acuna.  Time varying offsets are needed because the           
offsets drift slightly as the magnetometer temperature changes. (The          
MAG temperature is modulated as the spacecraft goes in and out of the         
Moon's shadow.) A constant offset is used for the Z component, because        
lack of spin modulation in that component precludes routine offset            
determination. Offsets are calculated separately for each data range          
and subtracted from the data. This correction reduces systematic errors       
in the X and Y components to less than ~0.1 nT. Since the Z component         
cannot be corrected in this way, systematic errors in that axis (due to       
temperature-induced offset drifts) can be as large as 0.5 nT.                 
Instrumental gains, different for each of the 8 ranges, are then              
applied to convert to nanotesla. Next, the data are corrected for a           
slight misalignment between the magnetometer sensor axes and the              
spacecraft axes. The resulting sensor (SEN) coordinate system has its         
Z-axis parallel to the spacecraft spin axis, and its X-axis aligned           
with the magnetometer boom. The SEN coordinate system rotates as the          
spacecraft spins. The next step is to flag spurious data values. The          
first measurement following a range change is flagged, since the finite       
time needed to make the change often corrupts the first measurement in        
the new range. Other false spikes also appear in the data, most of            
which are attributable to occasional noise in the telemetry. A                
comparison technique is used to remove outliers.  In practice, this           
effectively removes most  spurious data values without eliminating any        
valid data. The next step is to ''despin'' the data from SEN to               
''despun spacecraft'' (SCD) coordinates, which are defined such that          
the Z-axis is parallel to the spacecraft spin vector, and the direction       
of the sun is in the half-plane defined by X &#10095; 0, Y = 0. Despinning is        
performed using the reconstructed sunpulse data, which are corrected          
for spacecraft spin-up in the Moon's shadow.  Next, the data are              
averaged in 5-second intervals; this reduces the data volume by a             
factor of 45.  Finally, a rotation is performed from SCD coordinates to       
selenocentric solar ecliptic (SSE) and body-fixed selenocentric (SEL)         
coordinates using the spacecraft ephemeris data (the latitude and             
longitude of the spin axis obtained from files included in the PDS            
distribution of the LP Level-1 magnetic field data) and lunar ephemeris       
data obtained from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Horizons system            
(&#10094;http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.html&#10095;). SSE coordinates are defined        
such that the X-axis points from the center of the Moon to the center         
of the Sun, the Z-axis is parallel to Earth's ecliptic north, and the         
Y-axis completes the right-handed coordinate system. SEL coordinates          
are defined such that the Z-axis is parallel to the Moon's spin vector        
(north pole) and the X and Y axes intersect the lunar equator. The            
X-axis intersects the lunar equator at 0 degrees longitude, and is thus       
nearly aligned with the Moon-Earth line. (It is not exactly aligned           
because of the Moon's libration.) The Y-axis intersects the lunar             
equator at 90 degrees EAST longitude: SEL coordinates are right handed.

Data are archived on CDROMs in level 1 compliance with the ISO 9660

averaging window in spacecraft event time, i.e., Universal Time at the        
spacecraft.  Example: 1998-11-08T05:50:42.5                                   
                                                                              
2) time parameter 2:  decimal day of the mid-time of the 5-sec averaging      
window in spacecraft event time, i.e., Universal Time at the spacecraft.      
                                                                              
3) mag_field_SEL:  Array[3] giving B-field components (nT) in the SEL         
coordinate system                                                             
                                                                              
4) mag_field_SSE: Array[3] giving B-field components (nT) in the SSE          
coordinate system                                                             
                                                                              
5) mag_field_RMS: RMS deviation (nT) of the field magnitude.  Provides        
an indication of field variability for the 5-sec window.                      
                                                                              
6) Spacecraft SEL coordinates: coordinate array[3]  (km)

8) ISUN - a parameter from the sunpulse file indicating whether the           
spacecraft is in the sun (0), in eclipse (1), or, if the sunpulse file        
was not available, the data were processed using the less accurate            
determination of the sunpulse time in the Level-0 data file and ISUN is       
set to 2.  Note that this parameter contains erroneous values (0 &#10094;-&#10095; 1)       
from time to time.  To reduce the occurrence of bad ISUM values the           
parameter was median-filtered with a 9-point window, which removes most       
of the errors.                                                                
                                                                              
These parameters could be named PDS_time, decimal_day, Bx_sel, By_sel,        
Bz_sel, Bx_sse, By_sse, Bz_sse, B_rms, x_sel, y_sel, z_sel, x_sse,            
y_sse, z_sse, isun                                                            
                                                                              
An appropriate format for reading the data is:

however, the records contain blanks between each parameters so that a

The SSE coordinate system has its X-axis along the Moon-Sun line,             
positive towards the Sun. The Z-axis is parallel to the northward             
normal to the Earth's ecliptic plane, and Y completes the right-handed        
set. The SEL coordinate system used here is a Cartesian representation        
that places the Z-axis along the rotation axis of the moon, positive in       
the direction of angular momentum. The X-axis lies in the lunar               
equatorial plane at 0 degrees longitude, and Y completes the                  
right-handed set.

Magnetometer data quality was reviewed by D.L. Mitchell (UC-Berkeley),        
M.H. Acuna (NASA-GSFC), and L.L. Hood (LPL-Univ. Arizona). Further

Limitations:                                                                  
===========                                                                   
                                                                              
The magnetometer data should be used in conjunction with spacecraft           
ephemeris data so that perturbations to the ambient magnetic field            
vector due to crustal sources can be localized in selenographic               
coordinates. It is also important to evaluate the plasma environment          
using electron reflectometer data, since the Moon can be in the solar         
wind, in the Earth's magnetosheath, in a geomagnetic tail lobe, or in         
the geotail current sheet. The plasma environment can strongly                
influence the usefulness of the data for probing lunar crustal magnetic       
fields. By far, the best (steadiest) data are obtained in the                 
geomagnetic tail lobes.                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
Data Quality:                                                                 
============                                                                  
                                                                              
Magnetometer data are of excellent quality. Systematic errors in the          
magnetic field component orthogonal to the spacecraft spin vector have        
been reduced to ~0.1 nT by time-variable offset corrections (see              
above). Systematic errors in the magnetic field component parallel to         
the spin axis can be as large as ~0.5 nT.  The B_RMS value provides an        
indication of the field variability during the 5-sec window.  A single,       
large value for the B_RMS would likely indicate that bad-telemetry or         
some similar problem had caused large variability during a single             
averaging window.                                                             
                                                                              
                                                                              
Data Coverage:                                                                
=============                                                                 
                                                                              
Magnetic field data are obtained continuously; however, telemetry gaps        
do occur. A table of gaps in the raw merged telemetry data OUTAGES.TAB)       
is available in the Level 0 Lunar Prospector archive, but is not part         
of the present Level 1 archive. Other gaps may exist due to data              
contamination or processing limitations.  In particular, we list in           
Appendix A, times when we have explicitly removed data from the dataset       
for reasons such as corrupted sun pulse data preventing the despinning        
of the magnetic field data.   There are also a number of data gaps that       
result because the MAG/ER instruments were telemetering burst mode            
data; these intervals are listed in Appendix B.
