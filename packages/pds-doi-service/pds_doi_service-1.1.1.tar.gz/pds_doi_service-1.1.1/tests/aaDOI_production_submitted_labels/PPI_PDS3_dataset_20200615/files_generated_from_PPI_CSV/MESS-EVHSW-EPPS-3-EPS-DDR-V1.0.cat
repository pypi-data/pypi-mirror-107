    Abstract
    ========
      This data set consists of the MESSENGER Energetic Particle and
      Plasma Spectrometer (EPPS) advanced data products, also known
      as DDR/DAPs. The system encompasses 2 instrument subsystems - the
      Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPS) and the Fast Imaging Plasma
      Spectrometer (FIPS). This data set contains EPS instrument data.
      EPS covers the energy range of 25 to &#10095; 500 keV for electrons, and
      10 keV/nucleon to ~3 MeV total energy for ions. There is one
      DDR data product for EPS"

    Data Set Overview
    =================
      The data set consists of advanced data products, also known as
      DDR/DAPs.

      For all the DDR products there is a detached PDS label file that
      describes the contents of one data file. Each label file will have
      the same base name as the data file it is describing, with the
      extension .LBL to denote a label file. The label file defines the
      start time and end of the observation, product creation time, and
      the structure of the ASCII tables. Each data product is identified
      within the PDS label by a STANDARD_DATA_PRODUCT_ID value, shown in
      parentheses in the table below.

      The EPS portion of the data archive consists of three DDR data products.
      These are tables of pitch-angle values, select pitch-angle distribution
      function spectrograms provided as image plots, and daily pitch-angle
      distribution function spectrograms provided as image plots covering the
      entire EPS data set during the Mercury Orbit phases.
      
      The pitch angle value table DDRs are included in both releases 9 and 11.
      The pitch angle value tables in release 11 include the entire EPS data
      set covering the Mercury Orbit Year 2.
      
      A set of EPS pitch angle spectrogram plot products were included in
      release 9. They cover selected time periods within the years 2011 and
      2012 that the instrument team determines to be of particular interest.
      These were a one-time delivery containing plots in PNG format (.PNG).
      These may be found in the EPS_PITCH_ANGLES_SPECTROGRAM directory within
      the archive volume.
      
      In release 16, the complete set of pitch angle spectrograms containing
      both plots in PNG format and also data points in text format
      (.TAB files) were released. These are daily products covering the entire
      Mercury orbit years instead of just selected time periods. These may be
      found in the EPS_PA_DAILY_SPECTROGRAM directory within the archive
      volume.
 
      These products are summarized in the data table below. A more
      complete description of each product may be found in the EPPS DDR SIS
      document, located in the DOCUMENT directory of the document volume.


    Instrument Overview
    ===================
      The EPS sensor consists of a 60-mm diameter, tuna-can-like
      cylinder, in which a start foil and stop foil, wrapped around
      opposite curved sides of the cylinder, constitute the TOF chamber.
      Please note that the TOF section suffered a failure shortly after
      launched, hence no flight TOF data are included in any data release.
      The solid-state detectors are arranged so that each detector senses the
      events within a given range of incidence angles. Each of the 6
      detector modules is composed of 4 pixels: large and small ion and large
      and small electron. The reported energies are the deposited particle
      energy.

      See the EPPSINST.CAT file for more information and [ANDREWSETAL2007] for
      full details.


    Calibration Overview
    ====================
      This data set is normalized and background subtracted. Please refer to
      Livi et al. for full description of the EPS calibration.
      
      [Livi et al., 'MESSENGER Energetic Particle Spectrometer (EPPS/EPS)
      Calibration Report', 2004 (at PDS Geosciences node  messgc_0001/EPS/
      EPS_CAL_RPT)]

    Parameters
    ==========

   The accumulation times for each event are 120 seconds for the EPS
   Pitch Angle Spectrogram. Calibration
   parameters are described in the Calibration Implementation document.


    Data
    ====
      EPS Pitch Angle table (EPSP_A)
      
      The pitch angle values tables contain the pitch angle for each of
      the six look directions reported at the same cadence as the EPS 
      LoRes Spectral rate measurements (see EPPS CDR document). Each file
      thus has a one-to-one relationship with a corresponding LoRes 
      spectral file.


      EPS Pitch Angle Spectrogram (EPS_PAS)
      
      Contains a plot of the pitch angle spectrogram as an image in PNG
      format (.PNG) for the EPS odd-numbered shaped channels (ion=1,5,7,9). A
      given pitch angle spectrogram DDR data file contains all the
      observations obtained on one electron event. The particle measurement is
      120 seconds averaged.  0 denotes the same direction as the measured
      magnetic field, and 180 is opposite to the local field.  The color scale
      is normalized to the maximum flux for the time interval covered in the
      plot.

      EPS_PA_DAILY_SPECTROGRAM (EPS_PASD)
      
      Contains pitch angle spectrogram products as described above, but as
      daily products covering the full orbital phases of the mission.
      Furthermore, these also contain text data files (.TAB) for each
      spectrogram in addition to the plots (.PNG)."

    Confidence Level Overview
    =========================
      The EPPS DDR data are the processed data set released for the       
      EPPS.  Data presented here are an accurate representation of the EPPS
      data as received from the spacecraft and have been processed from
      instrument unit to physical unit.


    Review
    ======
      The EPPS DDR was reviewed internally by the EPPS team prior to
      release to the PDS. PDS also performed an external review of the
      EPPS CDR.

      The EPS pitch angle distribution data have been corrected for 
      priority scheme in the instrument processor. 

      During orbital phase, a certain sector in the EPS field-of-view had a
      direct view of the sunlit side of the planet. During these periods, the
      single event data (Fast, Scanned, etc) may have been susceptible to
      photon contamination. The science event data (all rate and spectra data)
      had additional on-board software processing that should have eliminated
      this photon contamination, but the user should always consult with the
      instrument team at JHU/APL to verify the quality of specific data prior
      to publication.

      During spacecraft noon-midnight orbits, the EPS instrument temperature
      can rise to levels that affect the low energy channels.  We have noticed
      during some of these orbits, the temperature induced noise rendered
      those energy channels below 100 keV to be useless.  In addition, the
      higher than normal temperature also induced a data 'drop-out' where the
      count in all rate drops by a factor during one integration period and
      remains so for a few minutes to hours.  The EPS team has investigated
      the cause of this 'drop-out'.  Users should always consult the
      instrument team at JHU/APL to verify the quality of specific data prior
      to publication.

      During orbital phase, the EPS routinely switched between large and small
      pixels on both the ion and electron detectors.  Users should check the
      pixel size flag in the data to know which pixel the detectors were
      using.

      EPS Shaped channel Sector 3 and 11 had malfunctioning detectors and did
      not produce any data products.

      As always, users of the EPPS data should consult with the instrument
      team at JHU/APL to verify the quality of specific data prior to
      publication.

    Limitations
    ===========
      This data set is fully processed, science quality data.  It has been
      reviewed at high level by the EPS instrument team.  It has not been, 
      however, manually validated on a point by point.  Users are 
      encouraged to contact the EPS instrument team when questions about 
      the data arise.  Some analysis of this data requires detailed 
      knowledge of EPS pointing which can be extracted from SPICE."
