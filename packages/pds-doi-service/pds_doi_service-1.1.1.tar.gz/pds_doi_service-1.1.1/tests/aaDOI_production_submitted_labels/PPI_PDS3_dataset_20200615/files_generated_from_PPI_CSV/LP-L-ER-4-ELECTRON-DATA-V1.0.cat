  Overview:

    Lunar Prospector Electron Reflectometer (ER) Level 2 Data represent       
    a time ordered series of derived quantities from electron reflection      
    measurements by the Electron Reflectometer (ER) instrument aboard the     
    Lunar Prospector (LP) polar orbital mission to the Moon (January 1998     
    to July 1999).  Each data file contains data from a single energy         
    channel: 200 eV, 220 eV, 340 eV, 520 eV, or 590 eV.  The processing       
    level of these data is Level 2 by NASA standards, but is Level 4          
    according to the CODMAC definitions.                                      
                                                                              
                                                                              
  ======================================================================      
  Parameters:                                                                 
  =========                                                                   
                                                                              
    Each record consists of a time tag followed by 7 scalar values.  The      
    first two columns after the time tag provide the selenographic            
    (body-fixed) longitude and latitude of the ER measurement footprint,      
    which is obtained by extrapolating the magnetic field vector              
    measured at the spacecraft along a straight line until it intersects      
    the Moon.  The next column gives the average magnetic field amplitude     
    in nanoteslas, measured at the spacecraft (|B_sc|), during the time       
    interval of each ER measurement.  The next two columns give the cutoff    
    pitch angle (A) and its uncertainty (in degrees) for electrons reflected  
    from the lunar surface at the energy channel of the file.  The last two   
    columns give the effective electron reflection coefficient (R) and its    
    uncertainty.  The effective reflection coefficient is the ratio of the    
    reflected flux to the incident flux for an ideal uniform pitch angle      
    distribution, and is an indicator of surface magnetic field strength.     
    This is calculated from the loss cone angle: R = |cos(A)|.  From this,    
    an estimate of the surface magnetic field, uncorrected for electrostatic  
    reflection, can be calculated:

  Processing:                                                                 
  =========                                                                   
                                                                              
    This data set was prepared from the ER Low-Resolution (ERLR) data         
    set.  The following description is an overview of the processing of       
    the ERLR data set, adapted from PDS documentation for that data set.      
                                                                              
    Processing is carried out at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) of       
    the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), to convert the raw          
    data to measurements of the omnidirectional electron flux (cm-2 s-1       
    ster-1 eV-1) as a function of time.  Because of the instrument's          
    high dynamic range (six decades), the onboard digital processing          
    unit (DPU) compresses the raw counts in a logarithmic scale.  The         
    first step is to decompress the raw counts and construct a                
    two-dimensional data array, where the first dimension is time             
    (1 element every 16 spins), and the second dimension is energy            
    (15 elements).                                                            
                                                                              
    Raw count rate (R) is obtained by dividing the raw counts by the          
    integration time, which is a function of energy.  In general terms,       
    the integration time is longer at higher energies in order to             
    improve counting statistics.  The data are next corrected for             
    deadtime.  During the time it takes the instrument to process a           
    single electron (known as the ''deadtime'', which is about                
    0.3 microsec for the ER), it ignores any other electrons.  The raw        
    count rate is multiplied by the factor 1/(1 - RT), where T is the         
    deadtime, to obtain the corrected count rate.  Data values are            
    masked when the deadtime correction factor exceeds 1.25.  Note that       
    a background count rate due to cosmic rays and noise in the               
    electronics (about 10 counts/sec) has not been subtracted.  In most       
    cases, measurements in the highest energy channel (20 keV) are            
    dominated by background, which allows this channel to be used as a        
    baseline for estimating the background level in lower energy              
    channels.  Finally, one divides by the geometric factor                   
    (0.02 cm2 ster) and the center energy (eV) to obtain the                  
    differential particle flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1).                        
                                                                              
    Electron flux uncertainties include Poisson counting statistics and       
    digitization noise (associated with the lossy logarithmic compression     
    used to maximize science return within the ER telemetry allotment).       
    Flux uncertainties DO NOT include the absolute uncertainty in the         
    geometric factor, which was estimated from electrostatic optics           
    simulations, including corrections for internal grid transmissions        
    and MCP efficiency.  However, absolute calibration is not necessary       
    for most applications of these data, which are based on the shape of      
    the pitch angle distribution and not its absolute flux level.             
                                                                              
    The differential particle flux is measured in 16 angular sectors          
    spanning the 360-degree disk-shaped field of view.  During one            
    half of a spacecraft spin (~2.5 seconds) this field of view sweeps        
    over the entire sky (4-pi steradians).  Given the magnetic field          
    measured onboard by the LP Magnetometer, the field of view is mapped      
    into pitch angle (the angle between the electron velocity and the         
    magnetic field direction) to create a pitch angle distribution.           
    A step function is fit to the pitch angle distribution to determine       
    the cutoff pitch angle (A) and its associated statistical uncertainty.

    at high speed (order of one Moon diameter per second).  Thus the          
    electron data contain information about the plasma environment            
    as well as the large-scale configuration of the magnetic field,           
    which is sampled locally by the MAG.

  ============                                                                
                                                                              
    The ER data are generally of very high quality.  Three instrumental       
    effects should be noted. (1) Sunlight directly enters the ER              
    aperture twice per spacecraft spin.  These photons scatter within         
    the instrument and produce secondary electrons, which cause spurious      
    counts.  These counts have not been removed. (2) Electron fluxes are      
    relatively high at low energies, and at times the instrument becomes      
    saturated.  During processing, a deadtime correction of the form          
    1/(1 - RT) is applied, where R is the measured count rate and T is        
    the time needed to analyze a single electron.  This correction is         
    only reliable up to values of about 1.25.  (3) Low energy electrons       
    can be perturbed by the spacecraft floating potential relative to         
    the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  In sunlight, the         
    spacecraft floats a few volts positive, and in the Moon's shadow, it      
    floats tens of volts negative.  Electrons must cross this potential       
    before they enter the ER electrostatic optics; thus, all electron         
    energies are shifted by this potential relative to their energies         
    far from the spacecraft.  No corrections are made for spacecraft          
    potential effects.

    ERLR data are obtained continuously; however, gaps occur due to           
    telemetry interruptions, data contamination or processing
