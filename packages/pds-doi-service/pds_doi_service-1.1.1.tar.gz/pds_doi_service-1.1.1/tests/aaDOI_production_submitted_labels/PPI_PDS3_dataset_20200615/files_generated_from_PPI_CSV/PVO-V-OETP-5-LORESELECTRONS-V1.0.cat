This file gives the Ne, Te and Vs measurements derived by fitting the radial 
probe voltampere curves taken whenever PVO was within the ionosphere         
(ie., between the inbound and outbound ionopause crossings).  Data from      
essentially every orbit in 1979 and 1980 included ionosphere transits.       
After the summer of 1980, however, periapsis could no longer be              
maintained at low altitudes, and it rose slowly.  After April 1981 periapsis 
was above the altitude of the dayside ionopause, so the spacecraft           
encountered the ionosphere only in the terminator regions and on the         
nightside where the ionosphere extends to much higher altitudes. Dayside     
measurements again became available early in 1992 when periapsis             
returned to low enough altitudes.  The PVO Entry period of between July      
and October 1992 provided only nightside periapsis data.  During the         
intervening period (1981-91), only nightside UADS measurements in the        
high altitude (downstream) ionosphere were available.  Note that High        
Resolution Ne data from the 1981-91 interval provide measurements in the     
dayside magnetosheath and in the solar wind, but these data have limited     
accuracy because of spacecraft photoelectron contributions.  See Brace et    
al, 1988 (ref. 53) in the bibliography for further details on the            
interpretation of High Resolution measurements made outside the              
ionosphere.                                                                  
                                                                             
As noted earlier, the geophysical values are listed at 12 second intervals in
the UADS.  Each OETP entry represents a time-weighted average of those       
radial probe measurements taken within approximately 10 seconds of the       
UADS-assigned times.  If no voltampere curves were recovered within that     
20 second interval (this occurs at very low spacecraft telemetry rates), no  
UADS value is entered in that 12 second slot.  The instrument actually       
takes voltampere curves at a rate of 120/minute, but telemetry rate          
limitations permit the recovery of raw voltampere curves at intervals        
between 4 to 32 seconds, depending upon the telemetry rate and               
spacecraft data format currently in use.                                     
                                                                             
The Ne values in the UADS file may actually be based on either the ion or    
electron current collected by the probe, depending upon the magnitude of     
the density at the time.  The radial probe electron currents saturate the    
electrometer when Ne &#10095; 4x104 cm-3, so it is necessary to switch over to Ni   
measurements at that point.  Since the ion currents are about a factor of    
50 smaller, the Ni measurements can be made up to densities of about 2 x     
106 cm-3, much greater than is present anywhere in the Venus ionosphere.     
We assume that Ni = Ne everywhere in the ionosphere, so either may be        
used to construct the UADS file.  To minimize any discontinuity that may     
occur at the Ne/Ni switch-over point due to systematic measurement           
errors, Ne is normalized to Ni using a small universal correction factor.    
This factor is 0.7, and is based on comparisons of the overlapping Ne and    
Ni measurements from many individual orbits.                                 
                                                                             
There are good theoretical reasons to believe that the Ni measurements       
are inherently more accurate at densities exceeding 3 or 4x104 cm-3, so      
this normalization approach improves the accuracy of the Ne                  
measurements.  The Ni measurements become less accurate at lower             
densities because of uncertain changes in the ion composition, ion drift     
velocity, and a positive ion current component produced by                   
photoelectrons (Ipe) leaving the probe.  Ipe becomes comparable to the       
true ion currents at Ni of approximately 1x104cm-3.  The pe currents         
produce a spin modulated signal that is modelled using measurements          
made in the solar wind just prior to the bow shock crossing where the        
ambient densities are too small to produce detectable ion currents.  This    
spin modulated Ipe waveform, whose amplitude is different from orbit to      
orbit because of solar EUV variations, is subtracted from the net positive   
current measurements made in the subsequent ionospheric passage.  This       
subtraction gives the true ion current which is directly convertible to Ni.  
The spin maximum Ipe for each orbit is also used to construct the solar      
EUV file, as is described later.                                             
                                                                             
Because of the low spatial resolution of the UADS, and the fact that only    
ionosphere data are included, this file is not the best source of            
information about the ionopause.  Features such as the ionopause, and        
plasma clouds above the ionopause, are resolved better using the High        
Resolution Data File which is not restricted to measurements within the      
ionosphere.

The UADS data are based on operator-assisted voltampere curve fits.  The     
absolute accuracy of the data depends primarily upon the accuracy of the     
Langmuir probe theory (Krehbiel, et al., 1980) and our success in avoiding   
the inclusion of data from curves that were obtained in situations in which  
the theory does not apply (e.g., probe in wake of the telemetry antenna,     
very low densities, pe contamination, spacecraft potential too negative,     
etc.).  Where these effects have been avoided, the errors in Te should not   
exceed 5% when Ne exceeds 500 cm-3 in sunlight and about 30 cm-3 in          
darkness.  However, Te errors may be larger in regions of great spatial      
structure where the plasma parameters change while they are being            
measured, or in regions where the electron energy distribution is            
nonmaxwellian or appears to have two temperatures.  These conditions are     
often found in the nightside ionosphere and at the ionopause.  In these      
cases, the curve-fitting is done so as to measure the temperature of the     
lower temperature component of the plasma.  The curves would have to be      
refitted to obtain information on the higher temperature component.          
                                                                             
The accuracy of the Ne measurements is determined by the accuracy of the     
Ni measurements to which they are normalized by a fixed factor that was      
determined by comparisons at densities in the vicinity of 4 x 104 cm-3.      
Therefore the Ne accuracy is nominally 10%, but the error increases at low   
densities where pe background and/or spacecraft charging effects can be      
important, as described earlier.  Ne is given in the UADS file for densities 
down to 2 cm-3 and Te for densities down to 10 cm-3, which are observed      
only in the nightside ionosphere and ionotail.  The Ne error is expected to  
grow as the density approaches these limits, but the Te measurements are     
less subject to error at low densities because knowledge of Vs is not        
needed to obtain the temperature.  In spite of the reduced accuracy, Ne      
measurements below 30 cm-3 are retained in the UADS file because they        
do reflect real variations that may be of interest even when their absolute  
accuracy may be uncertain by a factor of 2 or more.  Examples include the    
detection of weak ionospheric tail rays and plasma clouds (Brace et al.,     
1987).                                                                       
                                                                             
The error in Ni is not expected to exceed 10% at densities above 4 x104      
cm-3.  Ne is used for densities below 4 x104 cm-3.  As noted earlier, Ne is  
normalized to Ni at their overlap point to gain the greater inherent         
accuracy of the ion measurements.  The normalization factor is based on      
the overlapping Ne and Ni measurements from many orbits, and the factor      
does not change throughout the mission.  Therefore, small discontinuities    
in the density measurement may sometimes be seen at the crossover point      
if ionospheric conditions lead to unusual spacecraft potentials, ion         
compositions, or other factors that are assumed constant when adopting a
