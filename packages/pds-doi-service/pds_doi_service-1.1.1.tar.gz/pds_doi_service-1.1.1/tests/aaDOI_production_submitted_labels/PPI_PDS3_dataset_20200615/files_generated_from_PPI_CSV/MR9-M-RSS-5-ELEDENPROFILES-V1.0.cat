     The Mariner 9 electron density profiles have been                        
     published graphically in [KLIORE1972A], [KLIORE1972B],                   
     [KLIOREETAL1973], [ZHANGETAL1990], and [KLIOREETAL1992].                 
     They were archived as microfilmed data tables and images                 
     at the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) as dataset             
     PSPA-00141, and this archive is described further at                     
     http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/datasetDisplay.do?id=PSPA-00141.          
                                                                              
     We requested data tables and plots of ionospheric                        
     properties as functions of radial distance for all                       
     occultations for which ionospheric peak properties were                  
     reported in [KLIOREETAL1972B] and [KLIOREETAL1973].                      
     We assumed that the absence of reported peak properties                  
     for a given occultation meant that no useful ionospheric                 
     profile was delivered to the archive. This approach                      
     primarily selected ingress occultations with solar zenith                
     angles less than 90 degrees, although a handful of the                   
     selected occultations have solar zenith angles between                   
     90 and 100 degrees. Neutral properties, although present                 
     in the archive and available to other interested                         
     researchers, were not deemed useful for our purposes.                    
                                                                              
     We provided a list of selected orbits to the NSSDC and                   
     subsequently received approximately 768 TIFF images of                   
     microfilmed information. The information in these images                 
     of data tables were processed using optical character                    
     recognition software, incorrectly recognized digits (which               
     were legion) were manually corrected, and results were                   
     stored as ASCII tables. Quality control for each occultation             
     was ensured by reproducing the accompanying electron                     
     density-radial distance plot and any similar plots in prior              
     publications. This process generated an electron                         
     density-radius profile labeled by its orbit number for each              
     available ingress occultation.                                           
                                                                              
     For productive scientific analysis, additional supporting                
     information is required. Tables in [KLIOREETAL1972B] and                 
     [KLIOREETAL1973] report latitude, longitude, solar zenith                
     angle, peak electron density, peak radial distance, and                  
     peak altitude for each occultation. We verified that the                 
     peak electron densities and peak radial distances reported               
     by [KLIOREETAL1972B] and [KLIOREETAL1973] are consistent                 
     with the recovered electron density profiles.                            
                                                                              
     Martian geodesy has evolved significantly since the Mariner              
     era, so the published latitudes, longitudes, and peak                    
     altitudes need careful consideration. Generally speaking,                
     pre-Mars Global Surveyor work tended to use areographic                  
     latitudes and post-Mars Global Surveyor work has tended to               
     spherical planet, which leads to areocentric latitudes.                  
     Since the difference between latitudes defined with these                
     two conventions is in any case always less than 1 degree,                
     we have interpreted the reported latitudes as modern-era                 
     areocentric values [SMITHETAL2001]. Longitudes in                        
     [KLIOREETAL1972B] and [KLIOREETAL1973] are west longitudes,              
     which were converted into east longitudes by subtracting                 
     them from 360 degrees. Tracking the many different reference             
     areoids used over the past four decades to convert radial                
     distance to altitude is a major undertaking, which we                    
     sidestepped by converting each occultation's list of                     
     of radial distances into altitudes using the radius of the               
     MOLA areoid at the appropriate latitude and longitude                    
     [SMITHETAL2001].                                                         
                                                                              
     The end product is a set of 114 electron density profiles                
     as functions of radial distance and altitude, each                       
     accompanied by orbit number, date, latitude, longitude,                  
     solar zenith angle, radius of areoid, radial distance                    
     to maximum electron density, altitude of maximum altitude                
     density, and maximum electron density. Electron density                  
     uncertainties were neither archived nor discussed                        
     extensively in publications from the Mariner 9 era, but                  
     they can be estimated for each profile as the smallest                   
     value in that profile.                                                   
                                                                              
     78 profiles were acquired during the primary mission on                  
     orbits 1-79 and 36 profiles were acquired during the                     
     extended mission on orbits 352-450. In the primary mission,              
     profiles typically spanned 80 to 300 km with a vertical                  
     resolution of 2 km and a lowest reported density                         
     of 700 cm^-3. In the extended mission, profiles typically                
     spanned 80 to 240 km with a vertical resolution of 1 km                  
     and a lowest reported density of 1200 cm^-3. Point-to-point              
     fluctuations in electron density are noticeably greater                  
     in the profiles from the extended mission than in those of               
     the primary mission. The high gain antenna was not pointed               
     at Earth during extended mission occultations, which                     
     reduced the signal-to-noise ratio of the experiments

     Precise timing information is not readily available for                  
     these profiles, although it could perhaps be provided by                 
     a diligent investigation of the relevant SPICE kernels                   
     (http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/M9/kernels/).                         
     We assigned dates to each occultation based on day of                    
     year information written on the microfilmed tables.

     ===============                                                          
                                                                              
     Data processing is described in the documents listed in                  
     the REF.CAT file and references therein.

     Given the small number of available occultations, data                   
     coverage is limited. No gaps have been identified in                     
     individual profiles. Uncertainties in the ionospheric                    
     electron densities are not known precisely, as discussed                 
     above.

     These data products come a spacecraft whose operations                   
     ended over 40 years ago. Therefore the documentation and                 
     other aspects of the dataset are not as complete as would                
     be expected for a current NASA mission. Nevertheless,                    
     it is felt that archiving the dataset in its current state,              
     thereby preserving it for posterity, is better than risking              
     that it be lostirrevocably.
