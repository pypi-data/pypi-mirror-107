  Electron Moment File Discussion                                             
  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
     First, some notes on the code itself - it assumes a zero bulk flow       
     velocity, due to the limited view of the ELS.  Zero velocity in assumed  
     in the spacecraft frame.                                                 
                                                                              
     In plasmas, the zeroth moment gives the density, the first moment gives  
     the bulk flow velocity vector, and the second moment gives a pressure    
     tensor or a temperature tensor.  Each moment in turn requires the        
     previous moments, i.e. the velocity moment requires density and the      
     pressure moment requires density and velocity.  But as we don't have a 3d
     sensor (like Cluster), we have to assume the plasma is isotropic, i.e.   
     what you see in one direction you also see in the opposite direction.    
     So, any velocity vector that you measure in one direction will be exactly
     cancelled by the velocity vector in the opposite direction.  So in our   
     case the bulk flow velocity will be zero.  In this case the              
     pressure/temperature tensor will become a scalar.                        
                                                                              
     Secondly, the calibrated numbers.  We have to convert the data into phase
     space density so we can subtract off the photoelectrons properly.  This  
     can be summarized as follows:                                            
                                                                              
     The ELS accumulation time is 0.0234375s.  So:                            
                                                                              
          data in counts/sec = data recorded / accumulation time              
                                                                              
     after taking into account telemetry periods where several accumulation   
     periods were summed or averaged.                                         
                                                                              
     To get the higher calibrated units, which are anode and energy dependent:
                                                                              
          data in DEF = data in counts/sec / geometric factor                 
                                                                              
          data in DNF = data in DEF / (energy * electron charge)              
                                                                              
          data in PSD = (data in DEF * electron mass squared) /               
                        (2 * (energy * electron charge) squared)              
                                                                              
                                                                              
     The geometric factor (with efficiency rolled in) can be found in the     
     CALIB directory.  The units on geometric factor are str m^2 eV/eV per    
     anode. The updated file is always on the ELS managed web site:           
     http://www.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/~lkg/ELS_calibrations/geometric_factor.html    
     For more information, the ELS calibration paper talks in depth about the 
     geometric factor. [LEWISETAL2010]                                        
                                                                              
     Background subtraction comes from analysis of data from 15th Sep 06,     
     14th Jan 07 and 17th Jun 07, which assigns background levels per anode   
     based on actuator position.  The analysis was published in 2009 in a     
     paper by Arridge et al [ARRIDGEETAL2009].                                
                                                                              
     Here's a summary of what the code does.                                  
                                                                              
     Read in data, average by A-cycle (and A-cycle is a 32 second instrument  
     cycle).                                                                  
     Per A-cycle:                                                             
       Subtract background, taking the actuator position from the mid-point   
           of the A-cycle.                                                    
       Convert data to PSD (phase space density), remove photoelectrons.      
       Remove spacecraft potential (also taken from mid-point of the          
           A-cycle) from instrument energy array                              
       Get the radial cell limits for each energy bin in m/s from the         
           spacecraft-potential-subtracted energy array                       
       For each bin, density = 4pi/3 * data * (top limit velocity ^3 -        
           bottom limit velocity ^3)                                          
       Sum all bin densities to get total density.                            
       Calculate temperature constant t_const =                               
           (4 * mass_electron * pi) / (15 * density * Boltzmann's constant)   
       For each bin, temperature = t_const * data * (top limit velocity ^5 -  
           bottom limit velocity ^5)                                          
       Sum all bin temperatures to get total temperature.                     
       Convert temperature from Kelvin to eV with                             
           temperature = temperature * 8.61752d-5                             
                                                                              
     Then get a quality factor by:                                            
       Get peak energy of a Maxwellian from the actual density and            
           temperature from the moments calculated. Calculate the             
           theoretical peak energy that a Maxwellian would have with the      
           temperature from the calculated moments (identically equal to

           the geometric factor at that energy (geom)                         
       Get peak phase space density of same:

       Get the peak count rate from that lot:                                 
           peak_cr=peak_psd*2(energy*charge_e)^2*geom/(mass_e^2)              
       Get the Poissonian error on the peak count rate:                       
           std_dev_cr=SQRT(peak_cr/accutime)

           quality_factor=(peak_cr-42.7)/std_dev_cr

    The data are stored in multiple data files and have been organized        
    in folders, first by higher order data type and then by year.  Each file  
    contains a maximum of 24 hours of data.  Note that data is included in    
    the file based on the start time, and not the end time of the data.       
    Format of the data files can be found in the CAPS instrument archive      
    specification [FURMANETAL2013].  The format can also be found in the      
    .LBL files in the FM/HIGHERORDER/ELEMOMT/YYYY specific directory,

      There are many gaps in the CAPS data stream and there are many          
      different sources for these gaps.  Sources of gaps are as follows:      
          a. telemetry outages                                                
          b. data policing violations (CAPS data volume higher than           
             allocated)                                                       
          c. incorrect spacecraft data management commanding                  
          d. telemetry commanding during Cruise                               
          e. instrument anomalies                                             
          f. instrument modes which don't return all data products            
          g. planned instrument power-off and/or sleep periods                
          h. instrument off due to bus imbalance/short issues                 
      When there is no data for a time period, one of the above sources       
      is the reason behind the gap.  There is no indicator to which of        
      the sources is responsible for the gap in data coverage.                
                                                                              
    Poor Data

      When the code generating electron moments and spacecraft potential      
      generates data that is outside the expected minimum or maximum, the     
      data is replaced with fill values.  Hence, some time periods may appear 
      to have data, but many of records have been filled.  The assumption is  
      that the code is working, but enviormental effects do not lend to       
      correct data.                                                           
                                                                              
  Limitations

      The main limitation for the Electron moments and spacecraft potential   
      files is when the code generates data outside the minimum and maximum   
      values.  This limitation will be addressed by the team with further use 
      of the data."
