    This data set includes 1-minute averages of the electric and magnetic    
    wave spectra obtained during the ~ 53-minute period that the Galileo     
    plasma wave receiver was operated at Venus.  The parameter provided for  
    the electric field spectrum is the electric field spectral density in    
    units of V^2/m^2/Hz. The magnetic field spectrum is provided in units    
    of magnetic field spectral density, nT^2/Hz.  The spectral information is
    averaged and binned into 49 logarithmically-spaced channels from about   
    6 Hz to 5.6 MHz for the electric measurements and 34 channels from about 
    6 Hz to 75 kHz for the magnetic.  Note that these 'channels' do not      
    generally correspond to the 158 specific channels described in the       
    instrument description document. The reduction in spectral resolution    
    for this data set was performed in order to make the set more conducive  
    to use as a browse data set.  The sources of this browse data set are    
    the High Frequency Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum      
    Analyzer which make up the Low Rate Science portion of the PWS.  During  
    the limited time of this data set, Galileo was skimming very close to    
    the Venusian bow shock and actually executed several shock crossings     
    during this time.  The plasma wave data included in this data set are    
    summarized by Gurnett et al. [1991]."

    have been checked for accuracy by including only those words from the    
    telemetry stream which did not have parity errors based on parity bits   
    included with the data as part of the PWS data processing unit functions.
