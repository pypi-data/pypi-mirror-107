    This data set contains plasma parameters from the Voyager 1              
    inbound magnetosheath and outbound data from the magnetotail             
    through the solar wind.  Inbound Voyager 1 passed near noon              
    local time, so it sampled regions of the magnetosheath where             
    flow is generally subsonic.  Distribution functions observed             
    were well represented by two convected isotropic proton                  
    Maxwellians, so this type of distribution was used to derive             
    the proton velocity, density and temperature.  Physically the            
    two populations represent the thermal plasma accelerated at the          
    shock (the colder component) and ions reflected once at the              
    shock before entering the magnetosheath (the hotter component).          
    The PLS experiment could not resolve alpha particles in this             
    region so no alpha parameters are provided; the neglect of               
    alpha made cause an overestimate of the hot proton component of          
    the plasma.  One sigma errors are provided for the fit                   
    parameters.                                                              
                                                                             
    The outbound data has fit and moment parameters; the fit                 
    parameters assume a single, isotropic convected proton                   
    Maxwellian distribution.  Although magnetotail data is                   
    provided, these data are unreliable; the density can be used as          
    an upper limit to the actual density.  Solar wind data are also          
    provided.  However, we recommend using the M-mode data for the           
    solar wind as the L mode data has lower energy resolution so             
    the temperatures are too high and the non-radial velocity flows          
    less accurate.  The L mode data are the best data to use in low          
    density regions of the magnetosheath, but in general the M-mode          
    data are preferable and this data should be used only to                 
    increase time resolution over that provided by the M-mode data.          
    Magnetotail and solar wind data in this data set are included            
    mainly to put the sheath data in context and show magnetopause           
    and shock locations.

      A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit               
      volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,            
      or energy/nucleon.  Discrimination with regard to mass and or          
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,            
      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument              
      limitations.                                                           
                                                                             
      Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are             
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or          
      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                  
      moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will           
      be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than            
      one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total          
      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                   
      densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian           
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as             
      the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of           
      each Maxwellian is given.

      A measure of the velocity associated with the temperature of           
      the ions.  It is formally defined as the Ion Thermal Speed             
      squared equals two times K (Boltzmann's constant) times T              
      (temperature of ion) divided by M (ion mass).  Each component          
      of a plasma has a thermal speed associated with it.

      A derived parameter giving the average speed and direction of          
      motion of a plasma or plasma component.  The velocity can be           
      obtained by taking the first moment of the distribution                
      function or by simulating the observations with some known             
      distribution function, usually a Maxwellian, to the                    
      distribution.  Velocities are given in heliographic (RTN)

  Confidence Level Overview                                                  
  =========================                                                  
    The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is             
    not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by              
    the separation of the observed current peaks in energy                   
    (assuming the plasma is co-moving). The spectra were fit using           
    2 proton Maxwellians with the same velocity. Alpha particles             
    were not fit, and thus the density of the hotter proton                  
    density may be overestimated as the second Maxwellian may                
    contain alpha as well as proton contributions. The magnitude             
    of this overestimate probably varies from a few to 20%. All              
    fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It           
    should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for             
    the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in               
    this region and will have a small effect the density and                 
    velocity values.                                                         
                                                                             
    Magnetotail and solar wind data are not reliable and are                 
    included only to put the magnetosheath data in context and to            
    aid in picking magnetopause and shock crossings.
