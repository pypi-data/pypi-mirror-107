  =================                                                          
    This data set contains magnetic-field data acquired during the           
    cruise and tour phases of the Cassini mission to Saturn. The data        
    set begins with data collected on 16 August (day 228), 1999 and ends     
    on 17 November (day 321), 2005 when the instrument failed.               
    On 16 August, 1999 two days before the spacecraft commenced Earth        
    swingby, the magnetometer boom was unfurled into its extended            
    position; a  configuration it maintained for the remainder of the        
    mission.  Magnetic-field data acquired prior to boom deployment are      
    limited and are significantly affected by spacecraft noise. These data   
    are of no scientific value and, consequently, do not form part of this   
    data set.                                                                
                                                                             
    Cassini carried two magnetometers: a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM)         
    and a vector-helium magnetometer capable of operating in both            
    vector and scalar mode (V/SHM). This data set contains the magnetic-     
    field and calibration data recorded by the helium magnetometer when      
    operating in scalar mode. The data are divided into time periods of one  
    day and saved in files using the UCLA flatfile system. In this system,   
    data are recorded in binary files that have associated text header files 
    describing the format and content of the data.                           
                                                                             
    The magnetic-field data are contained in the SHM data                    
    products which can be identified from the 'SHM*_C' in their file         
    names. The SHM submitted is already calibrated.                          
                                                                             
    Data are received from Cassini in science or housekeeping telemetry      
    packets. Data from both these streams form part of this data set.        
    The naming convention used for data files allows the telemetry           
    source and date of acquisition to be readily determined from the         
    file name. On any given date, the science and housekeeping data for      
    a particular magnetometer cover the same time interval to within a       
    few seconds. Science and housekeeping data files have identical          
    formats and are processed in exactly the same way.                       
                                                                             
    The magnetic-field data have been extracted from telemetry packets,      
    assigned time tags, and formatted into simple binary tables of           
    values in nano-Teslas.

    The Cassini spacecraft clock (SCLK) is a counter that advances by        
    one tick nominally every 1/256 seconds. SCLK times have the format       
    cccc:ttt, in which cccc specifies the number of full counts that have    
    elapsed (one full count = 256 ticks), and ttt indicates by how many      
    ticks the clock has advanced towards the next count, since the epoch     
    00:00:00Z 1 January 1958.                                                
                                                                             
    SCLK counts may also include a partition number, p/cccc:ttt. This        
    number is initially 1 but is incremented during the mission if the       
    SCLK counter is reset or somehow interrupted or altered. The following   
    discussion assumes a partition number of 1. For other partition          
    numbers, the determination of SCLK times requires knowledge of the time  
    at which the current partition was initiated.                            
                                                                             
    SCLK times are commonly recorded in MAG files as decimal counts. Time    
    may also be represented in MAG files as Spacecraft Event Time (SCET)     
    which, for Cassini, is Universal Time Coordinated (UTC). The             
    relationship between SCLK and SCET/UTC is dependent on the count rate    
    of the Cassini SCLK. Like most counter-based clocks, this rate is not    
    constant but drifts with time. Consequently, conversion of SCLK times    
    to SCET/UTC times requires knowledge of the drift rates. These rates     
    are recorded in the SCLK/SCET coefficients file maintained by the        
    Cassini Spacecraft Operations (SCO) team at JPL. As the Cassini mission  
    progresses, the difference between SCLK and SCET will typically be of    
    order tens of minutes.

  ==========                                                                 
    The processing software converts time from SCLK(1958) to TAI, subtracts  
    a small calibration correction from the scalar field values, and appends 
    XYZ position of Cassini with respect to either Earth or Saturn in        
    IAU_EARTH or IAU_SATURN coordinate systems respectively. Only valid      
    Scalar data points (LOCK bit = TRUE) are written to the output flatfile. 
    A delay of 0.7s is subtracted from each time tag, 0.5s because the input 
    time stamp is the end of the 1s interval over which the measurement is   
    made, and an additional 0.2s determined from a fit of ESB data to the    
    model field. The additional 0.2s delay is subject to revision. In order  
    to calculate the calibration correction to the SHM value of B, the       
    approximate angles of the field are needed, which can be obtained from   
    the FGM. So for each SHM value, an FGM vector avg is calculated over     
    [t-1sec,t], where t is the SHM time. The FGM vector is then transformed  
    into the SHM/VHM sensor coordinate system (nominal deployed orientations 
    are used). A total correction, including a Bloch-Siegert correction, is  
    then calculated.

  Confidence Level Overview                                                  
  =========================                                                  
    There is irregular timing in the data samples.  This is caused by        
    the limited resolution of the msec counter in the time field.            
    For example, there are 128 FGM vectors in each science packet, the       
    time of the packet corresponds to the time of the first vector in        
    the packet. Times are calculated for the other vectors using the         
    known onboard vector sample rate and average exponent. These             
    calculated times don't have the reduced resolution of the msec           
    counter. Thus at the first vector of each packet there can be a          
    small time jump due to the msec counter resolution. This time            
    difference is maximum 8 msecs (not 4msecs which is the resolution        
    of the counter) because the DPU software only generates even msec        
    values due to internal truncation.                                       
                                                                             
    Data Coverage and Quality                                                
    -------------------------                                                
    There are routine events that cause data quality problems so             
    chronological listings of them have been included in this archive:       
      -calibration activities superimpose calibration data on top of         
       science data and are documented in SCAS_TIMES.ASC (for more           
       information on calibration activies refer to 'THE CASSINI MAGNETIC    
       FIELD INVESTIGATION' by Dougherty et al in this archive)              
      -data spikes may be seen at instrument range changes. Range changes    
       are documented in RANGE_CHANGES.ASC                                   
      -mode changes affect which sensors produce instrument data and         
       spikes or rapid changes in data averaging may be seen at mode         
       changes.  The first few packets after the instrument is unmuted or    
       after Science Packets recommence can be highly or incorrectly         
       averaged.  MODE_CHANGES.ASC lists the times of these events.          
    Range changes are the only routine events that will normally effect      
    SHM data.                                                                
                                                                             
    Data gaps may be instrument related (e.g. a sensor turning on/off) or    
    mission related (e.g. telemetry downlink problems). The former are       
    documented in MODE_CHANGES.ASC. All mission related gaps are listed in   
    GAP_FILEs - GAP_FILE_SCI_HK.ASC for science data in the housekeeping     
    packets and in GAP_FILE_SCI_SD.ASC for science data in the science       
    packets. Instrument related gaps of less than one day also show up in    
    the GAP_FILES as well as in MODE_CHANGES.ASC                             
                                                                             
    Most of the information in the GAP_FILEs are extracted from packets      
    received reports and so follow a fixed-width tabular format.             
    Multi-day gaps are not documented in the source listings and have been   
    added manually with a different format including an explanation of the   
    gap - if a reason is known.  A summary of scientifically significant     
    gaps is included below.
