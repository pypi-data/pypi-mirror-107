      This data set consists of the JUNO JEDI (Jupiter Energetic-Particle     
      Detector) calibrated observations, also known as CDRs. The system       
      is made up of 3 instrument subsystems (pucks) aligned in three          
      directions on the spinning JUNO spacecraft. The pucks each have 6 look  
      directions (telescopes) with a time of flight (TOF) and a deposited     
      energy detection (SSD) system.  In addition, the pulse height of the    
      signal in the TOF system can be used for energy measurement. The        
      instruments can be operated in a variety of modes, differing in the     
      way they use and combine these measurements. More details are available 
      in the INSTRUMENT.CAT file and the JEDI SIS.                            
                                                                              
      The CDRs are organized in files covering one day of spacecraft event    
      time (SCET). There are potentially 10 different files per puck,         
      corresponding to the available data gathering modes: HIERSESP,          
      HIERSISP, HIERSTOFXER, HIERSTOFXPHR, LOERSESP, LOERSISP, LOERSTOFXER,   
      LOERSTOFXPHR, NONPTOFXER, NONPTOFXPHR. Depending on how the pucks are   
      operated, not all data types will be available for all pucks for any    
      particular time range.                                                  
                                                                              
      All the measured quantities present in the uncalibrated data files      
      (EDRs) are present here in three forms: counts per accumulation (the    
      same numbers as in the EDRs), counts per second (this number may be     
      corrected for instrument saturation and background), intensity (counts  
      per second per steradian per cm2 per keV). Additional support           
      quantities are also included for the convenience or enlightenment of    
      the end user.

      The data set consists of calibrated observations, also known as         
      CDRs.                                                                   
                                                                              
      For all the CDR products there is a detached PDS label file that        
      describes the contents of one data file. Each label file will have      
      the same base name as the data file it is describing, with the          
      extension .LBL to denote a label file. The label file defines the       
      start time and end of the observation, product creation time, and       
      the structure of the ASSCI tables. Each data product                    
      is identified within the PDS label by a STANDARD_DATA_PRODUCT_ID        
      value, shown in parentheses in the table below.

    ===================                                                       
      The JEDI sensors consists of a 60-mm diameter, hockey puck-like         
      cylinder, in which a start foil and stop foil, wrapped around           
      opposite curved sides of the cylinder, constitute the TOF chamber.      
      The detectors are arranged so that each detector senses the             
      events within a given range of incidence angles. Each of the 6          
      detector modules is composed of 4 pixels: large and small ion and       
      large and small electron. See the INSTRUMENT.CAT file for more          
      information.

      This data set is calibrated; it provides the instrument team's          
      best available interpretation of the measured data at the time          
      of release.  This understanding is evolving and it is expected          
      that the calibration process will change and improve with subsequent    
      releases.

      The timing parameters in the CDRs are identical to those in the EDRs.   
      See JEDI_J_EDR_DS.CAT file for a short description or the JEDI SIS for  
      more detailed information.                                              
                                                                              
      In addition to the timing parameters and the uncalibrated counts, and   
      calibrated counts per second and intensity spectra, for each data       
      record in the CDR, we include ephemeris attitude and pitch angle        
      information for the convenience of the end user.  We also include a     
      subset of the basic rate information so the end user can obtain an      
      understanding of the level of activity in the instrument system as this 
      will affect the instrument performance.

     The JUNO JEDI CDR data are, at the present time, calibrated simply by    
     multiplying by a factor, determined for each individual telescope and    
     pixel, which captures the efficiency and geometric factor for that       
     detector. The underlying counts per second rate has not been adjusted    
     for background or instrument saturation effects. These are strictly      
     preliminary calibrations at this time.

     The JUNO JEDI CDR were reviewed internally by the JEDI team prior to
