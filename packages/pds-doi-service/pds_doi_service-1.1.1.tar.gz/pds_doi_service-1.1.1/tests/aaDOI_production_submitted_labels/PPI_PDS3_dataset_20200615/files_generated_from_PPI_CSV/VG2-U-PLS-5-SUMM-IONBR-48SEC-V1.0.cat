      This data set contains the total ion density obtained from             
      Voyager 2 PLS data (voltage range 10-5950 eV/Q) at Uranus              
      by fitting the measured spectra with isotropic Maxwellian              
      distributions. It is a subset of the data set                          
      VG2-U-PLS-5-RDR-IONFIT-48SEC. Up to three isotropic proton             
      components (warm, hot and intermediate) were used to match             
      the observations. These were then summed to give total ion             
      density. This determination does not include possible                  
      plasma outside the PLS energy range; limits on a cold                  
      component can be derived in the charging region from                   
      1939-2158 on day 24. It is found that if a cold component              
      exists it will increase the total ion density by at most a             
      factor of two. uncertainties in plasma parameters are a                
      factor of 2 in the charging region, less than 20%                      
      elsewhere. A complete description of this data set is given            
      in McNutt et al. (1987) and Selesnick and McNutt (1987).               
      Data format: first six columns are time tags (6I4), last               
      column is total ion density in CM-3 (E11.3). Values of                 
      1.E32 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained                
      from the data using the standard analysis technique.
