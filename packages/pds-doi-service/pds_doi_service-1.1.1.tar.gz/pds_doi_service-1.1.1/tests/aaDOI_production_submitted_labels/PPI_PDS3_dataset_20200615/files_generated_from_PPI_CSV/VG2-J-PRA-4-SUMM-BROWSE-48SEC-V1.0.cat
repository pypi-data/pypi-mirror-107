      This data set consists of edited browse data derived from an            
      original data set obtained from the Voyager 2 Planetary Radio           
      Astronomy (PRA) instrument in the vicinity of Jupiter. Data             
      are provided for 70 instrument channels covering the range              
      from 1.2 kHz to 1326 kHz in uniform 19.2 kHz steps, each 1 kHz          
      wide. Data are included for the period 1979-04-25 00:00:00.000          
      through 1979-08-04 23:04:00.000. In order to produce this data          
      set from the original raw PRA data, several steps have been             
      taken:                                                                  
                                                                              
      1. The PRA operates in a variety of modes; data from modes in           
      which the receiver does not scan rapidly through its frequency          
      range have been removed;                                                
      2. The data have been calibrated as best we know how;                   
      3. The data have been split into Left Hand Circular (LHC) and           
      Right Hand Circular (RHC) components;                                   
      4. The data have been binned into 48-second intervals.                  
                                                                              
      Thus, values at a given channel are separated in time by an             
      increment of 48 seconds; each 48-second time interval has               
      associated with it a value for LHC polarization and one for             
      RHC polarization.                                                       
                                                                              
      During data gaps, the entire record is absent from the                  
      data set; that is, missing records have not been zero-filled            
      or otherwise marked. Bad data within a record is indicated by           
      the value zero, which cannot otherwise occur.                           
                                                                              
      Each datum is returned as a 16-bit quantity; it represents the          
      mean power received in the given channel at the specified time          
      and polarization. The returned quantity is the value in mB              
      about a reference flux density. To convert a returned quantity          
      to flux, use the formula:

      =========================                                               
      This data set includes all the available low-rate scanning              
      mode data for the frequency range below 1326 kHz for the time           
      interval covered. Known bad data have been set to zero. Data            
      which appear to exceed the Full Scale Deflection (FSD) of the           
      instrument (i.e. the most intense signal which can be measured          
      reliably) have also been set to a zero (should they occur).             
      Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) suffers from interference from          
      many other instruments aboard the spacecraft. No attempt had            
      been made to remove these interferences in this data set. Two           
      obvious examples are the 136 and 193 kHz channels which are             
      nearly always contaminated by interference.                             
                                                                              
      The separation into LHC and RHC polarization components is              
      performed on the basis of the polarization of the incoming              
      wave as perceived by the instrument. This takes into account            
      neither the antenna transfer function nor the spacecraft                
      orientation with respect to the source. In general, the                 
      mapping of perceived polarization back to emitted polarization          
      cannot be solved without a knowledge of both of these factors,          
      as well as a knowledge of the type of polarization coming from          
      the source region (e.g. is it linear or circularly                      
      polarized?).                                                            
                                                                              
      Most planetary emissions are circularly polarized. Below is a           
      table showing the response of the experiment to a low frequency         
      (100 kHz) LHC wave. The response does not change much up to             
      about 5 MHz.                                                            
                                                                              
      The coordinate system used is: THETA == 0 is along the MAG              
      boom; PHI == 0 is the bisector of the two PRA antennas. The             
      third column is the apparent value of the left hand component           
      as perceived by the receiver. That is, a value of +1.0                  
      indicates that the incoming LHC wave is correctly detected as           
      a pure LHC wave. A value of -1.0 will be detected as being of           
      the correct strength, but incorrect polarity. A value of, say,          
      0.6 indicates that the total energy is split 60% into the
