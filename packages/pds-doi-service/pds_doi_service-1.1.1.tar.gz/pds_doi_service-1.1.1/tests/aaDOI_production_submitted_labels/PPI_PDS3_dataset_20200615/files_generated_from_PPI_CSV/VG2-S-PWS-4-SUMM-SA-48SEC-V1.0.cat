      This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data             
      within the interval of time covered. The data set has been              
      cleaned as well as possible for periodic noise spikes due to a          
      stepper motor operating on the LECP and a modulated grid                
      within the PLS. The averages do not include these noise                 
      spikes. Other possible sources of noise which have not been             
      eliminated include a nearly continuous tone at about 311 Hz             
      after closest approach due to interference from the gyros and           
      random intense spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz due to the             
      operation of attitude control thrusters. The data between 0040          
      and 0155 spacecraft event time on July 10 1979 is heavily               
      contaminated by thruster activity associated with a trajectory          
      correction maneuver. Other randomly occurring spikes or time            
      periods of intense spikes over the entire frequency range are           
      indicative of telemetry errors. No attempt has been made to             
      remove spikes since some could be valid data, i.e. real bursts          
      of wave activity. The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes                      
      contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument,                   
      depending on that instrument's mode. This interference is at a          
      relatively constant level. Also, a failure in the Voyager 2             
      flight data system a few months after launch has decreased the          
      sensitivity and the calibration accuracy of the upper 8                 
      spectrum analyzer channels (i.e. 1 kiloHertz and higher).
