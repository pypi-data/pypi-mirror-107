  Data Set Overview
  =================
    This data set contains data acquired by the Galileo Magnetometer
    during the Interplanetary Cruise to Jupiter. The data are at varying
    resolution depending on the averaging constant applied to the
    instrument. The EDR files (Experimentor Data Record) were delivered to
    the Galileo Magnetometer Team by the Galileo project. The EDR files
    are given in IBM 370 binary representation and are stored in an
    extremely compact format. The structure of the EDR files is completely
    described in the documents GLL280 and GLL640. The pages pertinent to
    the MAG description have been scanned into bit map images (TIFF) that
    are stored in the /DOCUMENT directory off the root of this volume.


  Data Acquisition
  ================
    The data for this dataset were acquired as part of the normal
    instrument calibration activities associated with the cruise to
    Jupiter. As such, the instrument was commonly configured in modes
    which required calibration even though they may not have been the
    optimal mode for science data acquisition. The Galileo magnetometer
    has 8 possible LRS acquisition configurations (modes). There are two
    sensor triads mounted 6.87 and 11.03 meters from the rotor spin axis
    (inboard and outboard) along the boom. Each of the sensor triads has
    two gain states (high and low). In addition, the sensor triads can be
    'flipped' to move the spacecraft spin-axis aligned sensor into the
    spin plane and visa versa. Please see the instrument description for
    full details on the instrument, sensors, and geometries. The
    combinations of sensor, gain state, and flip direction form modes.

    In addition to exercising the various instrument modes during the
    first earth encounters, numerous instrument calibration activities
    were performed. These include using both the internal and external
    calibration coils. Data corrupted by the use of the calibration coils
    or by the flipper motor have been removed from the raw data and kept
    in seperate calibration directories.


  Coordinate Systems
  ===================
    The EDR data are being archived in inertial rotor coordinates (IRC).
    This coordinate system has the Z axis along the rotor spin axis,
    positive away from the antenna and the X and Y axes lies in the rotor
    spin plane. In a crude sense, when the spacecraft is far from Earth,
    +X points south, normal to the ecliptic plane, positive Y lies in the
    ecliptic plane in the sense of Jupiter's orbital motion and positive Z
    is in the anti-earth direction. The spacecraft antenna (negative Z
    direction) is kept earthward pointing to about +/- 10 deg accuracy.


  Data Processing
  ===============
    The EDR files can be 'unbundled' using the software entitled
    'unbundle_mro80' or 'unbundle_mro32'. The unbundling software will
    read in a raw EDR and convert the data to IEEE binary flatfiles
    (tables of data). Prior to doy 169 1993 the EDR's were delivered to
    the magnetometer team by the Galileo Project in a 32 byte format. The
    appropriate software to unbundle EDR data in a 32 byte format is
    'unbundle_mro32'. After doy 169 1993 the Galileo Project delivered EDR
    data in an 80 byte format. The appropriate software to unbundle the 80
    byte format data is 'unbundle_mro80'. More information regarding this
    software can be found in the SOFTWARE directory of this CDROM.
    Information regarding the structure and format of the EDR binary file
    is contained in the documents GLL280 and GLL640. The pages pertinent
    to the MAG description have been scanned into bit map images (TIFF)
    that are stored in the DOCUMENT directory off the root of this
    volume."

        CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE          =" 

    Several of the EDR files contain errors which make it impossible to
    correctly 'unbundle' them.  These files have been retained in there
    EDR form but they have not been processed. These files can be 
    identified by checking the start and stop time in the EDR label. 
    Files which were not processed have a start and stop time labeled 
    as 'UNK' or unknown."
