      The high resolution data submitted to the NSSDC has its origins in the  
      original MVS 'Summary' data sets formally produced on the NSSC IBM MVS  
      mainframe system.  The original data sets contain a mix of engineering, 
      electron, magnetic field and plasma data.  The Voyager magnetometer     
      (MAG) experiment now resides on a dedicated workstation where only MAG  
      data are processed.                                                     
                                                                              
      All Voyager MAG data submitted to the NSSDC consists wholly of high     
      resolution LFM averages.  These files consist of a set of averages      
      applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  
      case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           
      1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   
      are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created
      from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   
      9.6 second averages.                                                    
                                                                              
      All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  
      coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      
      components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  
      been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager 
      magnetometer data.                                                      
                                                                              
    Coordinate System                                                         
    =================                                                         
                                                                              
      Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         
      coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   
      and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            
                                                                              
      The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   
      The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  
      orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    
      northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in 
      the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   
      plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      
      ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  
      drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         
                                                                              
      Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    
      Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     
      defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      
      system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    
      orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   
      points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the 
      solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane
      too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.

      systems may be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984),
