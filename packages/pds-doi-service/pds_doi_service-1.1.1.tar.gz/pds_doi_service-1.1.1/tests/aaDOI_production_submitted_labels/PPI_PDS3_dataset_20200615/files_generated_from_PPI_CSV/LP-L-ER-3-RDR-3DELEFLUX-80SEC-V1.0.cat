    The Electron Reflectometer 3-D (ER3D) data is a time ordered series       
    of electron measurements from the Lunar Prospector (LP) Mission.          
    Each record consists of a time tag with an 88 x 15 array of scalar        
    data points representing measurements of the electron flux in 88          
    solid angles covering 4-pi steradians and 15 energy channels              
    logarithmically spaced from 10 eV to 20 keV, with an energy               
    resolution (dE/E) of 25%.  Each data point is a measure of the            
    electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) within one of the 88               
    approximately equal-sized solid angles.  Angles are given in ''despun     
    spacecraft'' (SCD) coordinates, in which the Z-axis coincides with        
    the spacecraft spin vector, and the direction of the sun is in the        
    half plane defined by X &#10095; 0, Y = 0.  These data records are               
    accumulated during 1/2 spin of the spacecraft (~2.5 seconds) and          
    sampled every 16 spins (~80 seconds).  For convenience, the average       
    magnetic field vector during the ~2.5-second accumulation time is         
    provided to facilitate calculation of electron pitch angle                
    distributions from the 3-D data.                                          
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Parameters:                                                                 
  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
    The ER 3-D data are provided as differential electron flux in units       
    of particles per square cm per second per steradian per electron          
    volt.  The center angles of the 88 solid angle bins are provided in       
    degrees of longitude and latitude in the SCD coordinate system (see       
    below for the definition of SCD coordinates).  Note that the center       
    angles vary with energy, since the spacecraft rotates by 11.25            
    degrees during the time that the ER sweeps through its energy range.      
    Each of the 88 solid angle bins are approximately the same size.  The     
    exact sizes are given in the following table:

    longitude bins are of equal size within each latitude range.              
                                                                              
                                                                              
    ER 3-D distributions are recorded for 15 different energies ranging       
    from 10 eV to 20 keV.  The energy sweep was changed several times         
    during the mission for both instrumental and scientific reasons.          
    There are two basic sweeps, the first from 40 eV to 20 keV, and the       
    second from 7 eV to 20 keV.  The first is used to avoid instrumental      
    saturation in the solar wind, where fluxes are relatively high.  The      
    second is used to enhance the science return in the geomagnetic tail      
    lobes, where fluxes are relatively low.                                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Processing:                                                                 
  ==========                                                                  
                                                                              
    Processing is carried out at the Space Sciences Laboratory (SSL) of       
    the University of California, Berkeley (UCB), to convert the raw data     
    to measurements of the electron flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1) in 88         
    solid angles as a function of time.  Because of the instrument's high     
    dynamic range (six decades), the onboard digital processing unit          
    (DPU) compresses the raw counts in a logarithmic scale.  The first        
    step is to decompress the raw counts and construct a                      
    three-dimensional data array, where the first dimension is time (1        
    element every 16 spins), the second dimension is direction (88            
    elements spanning 4-pi steradians), and the third dimension is energy     
    (15 elements).                                                            
                                                                              
    Raw count rate (R) is obtained by dividing the raw counts by the          
    integration time, which is a function of energy and solid angle.  In      
    general terms, the integration time is longer at higher energies (to      
    improve counting statistics) and near the poles of the SCD coordinate     
    system, because the ER's disk-shaped field of view (FOV) always           
    includes the poles but requires the spacecraft spin to sweep the FOV      
    along the equator.  The data are next corrected for deadtime.  During     
    the time it takes the instrument to process a single electron (known      
    as the ''deadtime'', which is about 0.3 microsec for the ER), it          
    ignores any other electrons.  The raw count rate is multiplied by the     
    factor 1/(1 - RT), where T is the deadtime, to obtain the corrected       
    count rate.  Data values are masked when the deadtime correction          
    factor exceeds 1.25.  Note that a background count rate due to cosmic     
    rays and noise in the electronics (about 10 counts/sec) has not been      
    subtracted.  In most cases, measurements in the highest energy            
    channel (20 keV) are dominated by background, which allows this           
    channel to be used as a baseline for estimating the background level      
    in lower energy channels.  Finally, one divides by the geometric factor   
    (0.02 cm2 ster) and the center energy (eV) to obtain the differential     
    particle flux (cm-2 s-1 ster-1 eV-1).                                     
                                                                              
    The electron directions (i.e., the directions in the centers of each      
    of the 88 solid angles) are rotated into despun spacecraft (SCD)          
    coordinates using sunpulse data.  Special care must be taken when the     
    spacecraft is in the Moon's shadow, where the spacecraft spins up         
    slightly as the booms cool and contract.  This gradual spin-up is         
    reconstructed on the ground and is not available in real time as the      
    ER is collecting data and sorting it into the 3-D data array.  Thus,      
    the 3-D look directions must be corrected during post processing          
    based on the reconstructed sunpulse data.  Note that an electron's        
    direction is parallel to its velocity.  In other words, we record         
    where the electrons are going to, not where they are coming from.         
    Finally, the average magnetic field direction (in SCD coordinates)        
    during the accumulation time of the 3-D electron distribution is          
    calculated and saved with each 3-D data record.

       Each spectrum of 15 electron energies is represented by a set of       
       15 consecutive records in the table.  Each such spectrum has a         
       distinct spectrum number, which occurs in each record in the           
       15-record set.

    value associated with each of the 88 electron flux values.                
    THETA.TAB is an ASCII table with one row and 88 columns.

    The 3-D data are provided in ''despun spacecraft'' (SCD)                  
    coordinates, in which the Z-axis coincides with the spacecraft spin       
    vector, and the direction of the sun is in the half plane defined         
    by X &#10095; 0, Y = 0.  Throughout most of the mission the spacecraft           
    spin vector was within a few degrees of either the north or south         
    ecliptic pole.  Thus, SCD coordinates are closely related to GSE          
    coordinates.  Conversion to GSE coordinates is not performed because      
    the electrons are constrained to move along the magnetic field lines      
    in helices with radii of only a few kilometers.  Thus, only electron      
    directions with respect to the magnetic field are meaningful.  The        
    magnetic field direction is provided in SCD coordinates for each ER       
    3-D distribution, so that electron pitch angle distributions can be       
    readily calculated.

    The ER 3-D data are intended to be used in conjunction with               
    magnetic field and spacecraft ephemeris data, from which                  
    electron pitch angle distributions can be calculated and                  
    magnetic field line tracing to the lunar surface can be                   
    performed.  Magnetic field data are preprocessed (rotated to SCD          
    coordinates and averaged over the 3-D integration time) and               
    provided with each 3-D data record to facilitate calculation of           
    pitch angle distributions.  The magnetic field data are archived          
    in separate tables in two different coordinate systems, which,            
    together with spacecraft ephemeris data, allows field line                
    tracing to the lunar surface.

  ============                                                                
                                                                              
    The ER 3-D data are generally of very high quality.  Three                
    instrumental effects should be noted. (1) Sunlight directly               
    enters the ER aperture twice per spacecraft spin.  These photons          
    scatter within the instrument and produce secondary electrons,            
    which cause a false signal that can overwhelm the desired signal          
    from ambient electrons.  In the SCD coordinate system, sunlight           
    contamination appears as a flux spike in the direction of the             
    sun (0 degrees longitude, ~0 degrees latitude).  The flux spike           
    has a longitude width of about 14 degrees, and is more elongated          
    in latitude.  (2) Electron fluxes are relatively high at low              
    energies, and at times the instrument becomes saturated.                  
    A deadtime correction of the form 1/(1 - RT) is applied, where R          
    is the measured count rate and T is the time needed to analyze a          
    single electron.  This correction is only reliable up to values           
    of about 1.25, above which data are flagged.  (3) Low energy              
    electrons can be perturbed by the spacecraft floating potential           
    relative to the plasma in which the spacecraft is immersed.  In           
    sunlight, the spacecraft floats a few volts positive, and in the          
    Moon's shadow, it floats tens of volts negative.  Electrons must          
    cross this potential before they enter the ER electrostatic               
    optics, thus all electron energies are shifted by this potential          
    relative to their energies far from the spacecraft.  In addition,         
    the trajectories of low energy electrons can be bent by the               
    potential, so the imaging characteristics of the ER are degraded          
    for electron energies that are comparable to or lower than the            
    spacecraft potential.  No corrections are made for spacecraft             
    potential effects.

    ER 3-D data are obtained during 1/2 spin (~2.5 seconds) and               
    sampled every 16 spins (~80 seconds).  During this time, the              
    spacecraft moves about 128 km in its orbit.                               
                                                                              
    A table of gaps in the raw merged telemetry data (OUTAGES.TAB) is         
    included in the Level 0 Lunar Prospector archive (though not in the
