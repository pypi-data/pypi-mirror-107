    The first line of the header gives the Spacecraft, Instrument and         
    Data processing time. The second line of the of the header gives the      
    data processing input as 4 columns. The first two columns are             
    start/stop volumes where a volume is number of 15 minute intervals        
    from the start of 1989.  The last two columns are the start/stop          
    time given in Spacecraft Event Time (UTC) computed from the               
    start/stop volumes. Volumes times are provided in year and                
    fractional day-of-year (DOY) format for the center time of the            
    interval. In other words, you can compute the fractional DOY by the       
    formula:                                                                  
                                                                              
    DOY = [(VOLUME * 15) - 7.5] / (24 * 60)                                   
                                                                              
    The third line of the header contains the actual values for the same      
    start stop columns as the requested interval. The actual interval         
    may be shorter than the resuested interval if data are not available      
    for the entire requested interval. Line 4 is blank and lines 5-17         
    give livetime parameters which are described in further detail            
    below. Line 18 is blank, line 19 is column headings, and line 20 is       
    a line of underscores.                                                    
                                                                              
    Livetime parameters are summarized as follows:                            
                                                                              
    Rate Counts - holds the total number of ions which triggered that         
                  detector/buffer combination                                 
    Times       - refers to number of seconds during which the buffer         
                  was active                                                  
    PHA Counts  - is the number of ion event descriptions telemetered         
                  via that buffer, and                                        
    Livetimes   - are calculated from that info.                              
                                                                              
    Note that fractional livetime changes substantially during the            
    flare interval, so that averaging is required. The absolute flux          
    values are subject to an additional systematic uncertainty depending      
    on the relevance of the averaging technique to the use of the flux        
    values.

            -999 means the column is not applicable for this detector.        
                                                                              
    For LET B, the number of ions stopping in detector LB2 in the given       
    MeV/nucleon Energy-range is listed in the Doubles column, and the         
    ions stopping in LB3 are listed under Triples; the Total column sums      
    the double and triple coincidence events. The calculated value for        
    flux is given in the Flux column. Flux is given in units of               
    particles/cm^2-sr-sec-(MeV/Nuc). Lower and Upper refer to the             
    statistical uncertainties in flux values, giving the upper and lower      
    limits of the 68% confidence interval. Avg-LT is the average live         
    time of the detector/buffer combination, in seconds.                      
                                                                              
    For telescope LET E, the columns and refer to the same parameters         
    as those previously mentioned for LET B, with the exceptions of           
    columns triple, WS.L1*, and WS.L1. These headings refer to the            
    different event types in this telescope: triple refers to an event        
    triggering L1 L2 L3 L4* L5*, where an asterisk denotes a miss;            
    WS.L1* categorizes a wide-stop (L2 L3 L4 L5*) event which did not         
    hit L1; and WS.L1 indicates the wide-stop events which do trigger         
    detector L1 (L1 L2 L3 L4* L5*)."

    Note that fractional livetime changes substantially during the            
    flare interval, so that averaging is required. The absolute flux          
    values are subject to an additional systematic uncertainty depending      
    on the relevance of the averaging technique to the use of the flux        
    values."
