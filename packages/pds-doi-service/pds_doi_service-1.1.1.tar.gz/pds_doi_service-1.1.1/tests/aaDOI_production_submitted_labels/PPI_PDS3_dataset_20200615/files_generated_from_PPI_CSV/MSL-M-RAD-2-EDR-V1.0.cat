This data set contains data that is useful for determining                 
the energetic particle environment experienced by the Mars Science          
Laboratory rover at the surface of Mars. The EDR data products are     
raw data reconstructed from telemetry data products and formatted     
according to the RAD EDR Software Interface Specification (EDR      
SIS).                                                               
                                                                              
                                                                              
   Processing                                                                 
   ==========                                                                 

The Committee On Data Management and Computation (CODMAC) data         
level numbering system is used to describe the processing level of     
the EDR data product.  RAD EDR data products are considered CODMAC Level      
2 or Edited Data (equivalent to NASA level 0) products.  The EDR       
data files are generated from Level 1 or Raw Data, which are the        
telemetry packets.  After stripping away telemetry wrappers, the binary       
RAD observational data packets are split into individual data          
products and then concatenated in chronological order. The data        
are further organized into sols.  Therefore, an EDR data file contains a      
single data product from all the RAD observations taken over a         
Mars sol, as determined by the start time of the observation. It is           
possible that an observation may begin in one sol and extend into      
the next, 	but it will be archived only as data within the             
starting sol.  If data from one or more sols is incomplete, missing, or       
corrupted, the file will exclude these data.  An updated EDR will       
be generated if and when the data becomes available.

Each RAD EDR product consists of two files.  The first file is an      
ASCII formatted detached PDS label. The second file is a binary       
data file for a RAD product.  The data in a RAD EDR file is a copy of         
what was in the RAD memory buffer. That is, the EDR consists of       
unprocessed experiment data stored in binary format.  EDR data products       
are of one of two types, as identified in the EDR SIS:
