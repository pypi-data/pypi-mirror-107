This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                     
Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft               
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet              
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to                     
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series                 
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available            
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because                  
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                   
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,             
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                    
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged              
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are              
time averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)                          
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                 
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384                
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called              
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                   
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                
during the scanning periods.                                                 
                                                                             
   Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this                  
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;               
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special               
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,               
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute                  
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the               
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping                    
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data                 
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been               
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records                  
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.              
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods                
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)                  
are for 24 sec periods.                                                      
                                                                             
     The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             
                                                                             
     prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     
                                                                             
     24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     
                                                                             
     after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     
                                                                             
Please note that the change-over between modes is not                        
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the                   
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief                     
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)                 
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the                       
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach                      
position (not shown above).                                                  
                                                                             
     Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data               
a disjointed appearance.

Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from                 
4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between                 
adjacent (in energy) channels.                                               
                                                                             
     The channel data is given in units of intensity:                        
counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                
the raw count rates via the relation:                                        
                                                                             
                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    
                                                                             
where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 
V. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     
(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.                 
                                                                             
     The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with          
each channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the                  
two quantities: (i) one standard deviation Poisson statistical               
error, and (ii) a percentage assigned by the data supplier                   
based on the amount of contamination correction that has been                
performed on each data channel.                                              
                                                                             
     Also supplied with each record of this data set is the                  
fraction of the data accumulations that correspond to each                   
of the 8 angle sectors. For example, during a sector 7 stow                  
period, this number will be 1.0 for sector 7  and 0.0 for all                
of the other sectors.  A sector 9 has also been defined                      
corresponding to those accumulations with no known sector                    
assignment.                                                                  
                                                                             
    Additionally supplied for each data channel is a one bit code            
that tells whether that channel had any accumulations at                     
all associated with it (1 = yes; 0 = no).  This code must be                 
used to distinguish between accumulations that yielded no counts

Data Set Parameter 'PARTICLE FLUX INTENSITY'                                 
--------------------------------------------                                 
The channel data is given in units of intensity:                             
counts/(cm^2.sec.str.keV).  For the ions, it has been assumed                
that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                
the raw count rates via the relation:                                        
                                                                             
         I = CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                                 
                                                                             
where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The                      
proton values of these parameters were used in deriving the                  
intensities for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities                    
under the assumption that some other mass species dominates,                 
one must convert back to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton                
parameters, and then convert to intensity using the                          
parameters corresponding to the mass species in question.                    
The parameters can be found in Table 1 of Krimigis et al.                    
(Journal of Geophysical Research, V.  86, page 8227, 1981).                  
The corresponding parameters for electrons can be found in                   
Mauk et al.  (Journal of Geophysical Research, V.  92, page                  
15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity, the                     
count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background, (2)                     
electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and                 
(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.

Confidence note for the PDS Uranus LECP Scan data.                           
                                                                             
    High quality data is available from the LECP instrument                  
throughout the time period addressed with this data set.                     
The data is subject to errors associated with Poisson                        
statistics and associated with various kinds and levels of                   
contamination. The known contaminations are: i) penetrating                  
background, ii) Solar UV contamination within the lowest energy              
ion channel when the detector faces sunward, and iii) electron               
contamination of the lower energy ion channels (the contaminating            
electrons are measured).  Corrections have been made to the data             
in attempts to remove the effects of these contaminations.                   
                                                                             
     An error parameter is given for each particle intensity                 
value given in the data set.  This error is expressed as a                   
percentage.  This number is the larger of the following                      
items: 1) the one standard deviation Poisson error, and 2) a                 
value assigned by the data supplier associated with the degree               
of correction that was required with regard to the contaminations            
listed above.                                                                
                                                                             
     Missing data is indicated with a binary flag associated                 
with each energy channel. Each channel's flag will read 1                    
if at least one instrumental accumulation occurred for that                  
channel and for that record.  The flag reads 0 for no                        
accumulations.  This parameter must be utilized to distinguish               
between accumulations that yielded no counts, and the situation              
where there simply were no accumulations (the error parameter                
reads 100 for both cases)."
