      This data set contains plasma parameters from the Voyager 2             
      inbound magnetosheath and outbound data from the magnetotail            
      through the solar wind. Inbound Voyager 2 passed near noon              
      local time, so it sampled regions of the magnetosheath where            
      flow is generally subsonic. Distribution functions observed             
      were well represented by two convected isotropic proton                 
      Maxwellians, so this type of distribution was used to derive            
      the proton velocity, density and temperature. Physically the            
      two populations represent the thermal plasma accelerated at             
      the shock (the colder component) and ions reflected once at             
      the shock before entering the magnetosheath (the hotter                 
      component). The PLS experiment could not resolve alpha                  
      particles in this region so no alpha parameters are provided;           
      the neglect of alpha made cause an overestimate of the hot              
      proton component of the plasma. One sigma errors are provided           
      for the fit parameters.                                                 
                                                                              
      The outbound data has fit and moment parameters; the fit                
      parameters assume a single, isotropic convected proton                  
      Maxwellian distribution. Although magnetotail data is                   
      provided, these data are unreliable; the density can be used            
      as an upper limit to the actual density. Solar wind data are            
      also provided. However, we recommend using the M-mode data for          
      the solar wind as the L mode data has lower energy resolution           
      so the temperatures are too high and the non-radial velocity            
      flows less accurate. The L mode data are the best data to use           
      in low density regions of the magnetosheath, but in general             
      the M-mode data are preferable and this data should be used             
      only to increase time resolution over that provided by the              
      M-mode data. Magnetotail and solar wind data in this data set           
      are included mainly to put the sheath data in context and show          
      magnetopause and shock locations.

      A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit                
      volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge, or          
      energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or               
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             
      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               
      limitations.                                                            
                                                                              
      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           
      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   
      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          
      provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             
      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               
      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    
      densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian             
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          
      sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each           
      Maxwellian is given.

      A measure of the velocity associated with the temperature of            
      the ions. It is formally defined as the Ion Thermal Speed               
      squared equals two times K (Boltzmann's constant) times T               
      (temperature of ion) divided by M (ion mass). Each component            
      of a plasma has a thermal speed associated with it.

      A derived parameter giving the average speed and direction of           
      motion of a plasma or plasma component. The velocity can be

      The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is            
      not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by             
      the separation of the observed current peaks in energy                  
      (assuming the plasma is co-moving). The spectra were fit using          
      2 proton Maxwellians with the same velocity. Alpha particles            
      were not fit, and thus the density of the hotter proton                 
      density may be overestimated as the second Maxwellian may               
      contain alpha as well as proton contributions. The magnitude            
      of this overestimate probably varies from a few to 20%. All             
      fit values in the magnetosphere come with one sigma errors. It          
      should be noted that no attempt has been made to account for            
      the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10 V in              
      this region and will have a small effect the density and                
      velocity values.                                                        
                                                                              
      Magnetotail and solar wind data are not reliable and are                
      included only to put the magnetosheath data in context and to           
      aid in picking magnetopause and shock crossings.
