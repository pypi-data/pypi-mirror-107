  ==========                                                                 
                                                                             
    The instrument has detected superthermal, energetic or fast ions         
    whose energy exceeds 36 eV in the spacecraft frame of reference.         
    These ions were observed in early orbits during measurements of the      
    neutral density near periapsis, have an erratic and unpredictable        
    signature, and occur at too high an altitude to be due to the            
    neutral atmosphere. When the altitude of periapsis increased above       
    the point where sensible neutral density measurements could be made,     
    the instrument was configured specifically to detect superthermal        
    ions. In general, for orbit numbers 1 to 645, data were taken from       
    the RPA mode. The gas less in this mode than in non-RPA mode,            
    resulting in a lower detection threshold. For orbit numbers above        
    923, the instrument was deliberately configured with the filament        
    off and non-RPA mode data was used. For mass 16 the RPA voltage is       
    about +3.8 volts.                                                        
                                                                             
    The superthermal ion species regularly monitored include: He+, N+,       
    O+, (N+ +  CO+), and CO2+. Because of the paucity of data at other       
    mass numbers only mass 16 (atomic oxygen) has been reduced to a          
    flux and number density. As part of the reduction process the            
    angle in the ecliptic plane of the apparent ion flow in spacecraft       
    reference frame has been deduced. The flux values are estimated          
    in the spacecraft reference frame relative to spacecraft ground.         
    The density is computed from the flux by dividing it by a speed          
    corresponding to 40 eV. No correction has been applied to the            
    angle, density or flux in order to remove the effect of spacecraft       
    velocity.                                                                
                                                                             
    The data reduction process has been described in KASPRZAKETAL1987.       
    The method used to reduce the data assumes cylindrical symmetry of       
    the ion source. In actual fact, the source is asymmetrical in its        
    angular response (GUENTHER1989). This can introduce as much as a         
    factor of 2 scatter in the data. No simple solution has been found       
    for modeling this asymmetry since the actual ion drift vector is         
    unknown. The minimum energy of an ion detectable by the ONMS in this     
    ion mode is 35.9 eV. The maximum transmission is assumed to occur        
    about 10 V above this value. On the nightside of Venus the               
    spacecraft potential is negative and the most probable ion energy is     
    near 40 eV.

      All data were processed at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center using      
      custom programmed software.  The data represent a reduction to         
      physical units (density, flux) and were processed from an              
      intermediate engineering unit file (current, count/sec etc.). Unit     
      and 1/8 unit amu sweeps are not contained in the processed data        
      sets but are available from the engineering unit data set. The         
      engineering unit data is converted to ambient values using             
      spacecraft velocity and attitude, the theoretical expected system      
      response, and the corresponding calibration factors. Superthermal      
      ion data for species other than O{+} is available in engineering       
      unit form.

    In order to fit the data a minimum of 30 points were required in         
    36 seconds. In addition, the maximum to minimum count ratio was          
    required to be factor of 3 or greater in order to insure that there      
    was a definitive spin modulation. The center 12 seconds of data is       
    divided by the fitting function to derive the equivalent flux for        
    that point. The center of the new fitting interval is adjusted so        
    that it is centered on the expected signal maximum predicted from        
    the previous interval fit. As a result of this method of fitting,        
    discontinuities may exist near minimum angle of attack where one         
    12 second interval adjoins the next interval.
