returned to the ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration               
for the data.  However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived            
by Fourier transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by              
the spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be                    
obtained in most cases.  The data may be plotted in raw form to               
show the actual waveform; this is useful for studying events such             
as dust impacts on the spacecraft.  But the normal method of                  
analyzing the waveform data is by Fourier transforming the samples            
from each line to arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.           
By stacking the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-              
time spectrogram can be produced.

This data set includes all available waveform receiver data                   
obtained during the Uranus encounter.  There has been no attempt              
to clean various interference signals from the data.  Most of these           
can normally be easily seen in frequency-time spectrograms as                 
narrowband, fixed-frequency tones.  The most common include narrow-           
band tones at 2.4 and 4.8 kHz which are power supply harmonics.               
There is sometimes a tone near 1.7 kHz which is associated with               
the operation of the spacecraft gyros.  The spacecraft tape                   
recorder results in a rather intense band in the frequency range              
of a few hundred Hz.  There are few times when the data in this               
frequency range can be used.  However, there are times when the               
real signals in this frequency range can exceed the intensity of              
the interference sufficiently so that the frequency range near                
a few hundred Hz can be used.  Use of the spectrum analyzer data              
can be of use to determine when these time periods occur.  The                
stepper motor of the LECP instrument also interferes in the                   
frequency range of a few hundred Hz, but for periods of a few                 
seconds.                                                                      
The LECP interference is very intense and captures the automatic              
gain control so that real signals, even where there is no                     
interference, will appear to decrease in amplitude until the LECP             
interference fades in amplitude.  The PLS instrument periodically             
interferes at 400 Hz and odd harmonics because of a 400-Hz square             
wave used to modulate a grid in the detector.  The PLS interference           
lasts for several seconds and ends abruptly.  Telemetry errors                
result in a fairly graceful degradation of the waveform data.                 
Assuming the telemetry errors are randomly occurring bursts, they             
typically appear as an enhanced background level in the spectrum.             
Since the bursts are short, their Fourier transform is a broadband            
spectrum. When looking for relatively narrowband features or                  
features with distinct frequency-time characteristics, the result             
of the bursts simply reduce the signal-to-noise in the spectrum.              
One way of reducing the effect of burst telemetry errors is to pass           
the waveform data through a low-pass filter to despike it, prior to           
running the Fourier transform.  The waveform data is not subject              
to the negative effects of the failure in the Voyager 2 Flight                
Data System which reduces the sensitivity of the spectrum analyzer            
and affects the calibration above 1 kHz.  In fact, use of the 1 -             
12 kHz waveform data is an effective way of avoiding the problems             
with the spectrum analyzer data in this frequency range."
