    --------------------                                                     
      This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion             
      density at Jupiter during the Voyager 1 encounter in the PLS           
      voltage range (10-5950 eV/Q).  It is calculated using the              
      method of [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of            
      taking the total measured current and dividing by the                  
      collector area and plasma bulk velocity.  This method is only          
      accurate for high mach number flows directly into the                  
      detector, and may result in underestimates of the total                
      density of a factor of 2 in the outer magnetosphere.  Thus             
      absolute densities should be treated with caution, but                 
      density variations in the data set can be trusted.  The low            
      resolution mode density is used before 1979 63 1300, after             
      this the larger of the high and low resolution mode densities          
      in a 96 sec period is used since the L-mode spectra often are          
      saturated.  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a                 
      constant velocity component of 200 km/s into the D cup is              
      used outside of this.  These are the densities given in                
      [MCNUTTETAL1981] corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for            
      densities obtained from the side (main) sensor.  This                  
      correction is due to a better calculation of the effective             
      area of the sensors.  Data format: column 1 is time                    
      (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2 is the moment density in          
      cm^-3.  Each row has format (a24, 1x, 1pe9.2).  Values of              
      -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained            
      from the data using the standard analysis technique.

      A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit               
      volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,            
      or energy/nucleon.  Discrimination with regard to mass and or          
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,            
      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument              
      limitations.                                                           
                                                                             
      Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are             
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or          
      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                  
      moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will           
      be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than            
      one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total          
      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                   
      densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian           
      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as             
      the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of           
      each Maxwellian is given.

  =========================                                                  
    This data set provides an estimate of the positive ion charge            
    density.  Several assumption are made to simplify the analysis;          
    these may affect the accuracy of the results.  High mach number          
    flow is assumed; mach numbers of 2-3, which are reasonable               
    lower limits for heavy ions, result in 10-20% underestimates of          
    the charge density.  The analysis assumes a unit response (ie.,          
    all particles in a cold beam incident on the aperture of the             
    experiment would be measured at the collector).  The actual              
    response is documented in [MCNUTTETAL1981] and can be as low as          
    70%.  a velocity into the detector must also be assumed; the             
    velocity used is the corotation velocity inside of 17.5 R[J]             
    and 200 km/s outside of this.  This velocity profile is in               
    accord with that measured where velocity determinations are              
    possible, but the use of incorrect values give errors in the             
    density which vary linearly with errors in the velocity.                 
    Finally, only ions in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV/Q) are            
    counted.  The cumulative error from all these effects is less            
    than 10% in the solar wind, less than a factor of two in the             
    outer magnetosphere (R&#10095;20 R[J]) and less than 20-30% inside of           
    this.  Since the amplitude of each of these effects varies               
    slowly in time (distance), the relative changes in density are           
    good to a few percent in most cases.
