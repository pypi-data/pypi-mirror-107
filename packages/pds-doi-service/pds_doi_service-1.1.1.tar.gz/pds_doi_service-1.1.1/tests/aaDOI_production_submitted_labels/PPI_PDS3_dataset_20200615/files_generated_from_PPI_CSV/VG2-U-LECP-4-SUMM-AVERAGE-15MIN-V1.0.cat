          This browse data consists of resampled data from the Low           
          Energy Charged Particle (LECP) experiment on Voyager 2             
          while the spacecraft was in the vicinity of Uranus. This           
          instrument measures the intensities of in-situ charged             
          particles (&#10095;26 keV electrons and &#10095;30 keV ions) with various        
          levels of discrimination based on energy, mass species, and        
          angular arrival direction. A subset of almost 100 LECP             
          channels are included with this data set. The LECP data are        
          globally calibrated to the extent possible (see below) and         
          they are time averaged to about 15 minute time intervals           
          with the exact beginning and ending times for those                
          intervals matching the LECP instrumental cycle periods (the        
          angular scanning periods). The LECP instrument has a               
          rotating head for obtaining angular anisotropy measurements        
          of the medium energy charged particles that it measures.           
          The cycle time for the rotation if variable, but during            
          encounters it is always faster than 15 minutes. For this           
          browse data set only scan average data is given (no angular        
          information). The data is in the form of 'rate' data which         
          has not been converted to the usual physical units. The            
          reason is that such a conversion would depend on uncertain         
          determinations such as the mass species of the particles           
          and the level of background. Both mass species and                 
          background are generally determined from context during the        
          study of particular regions. To convert 'rate' to                  
          'intensity' for a particular channel one performs the              
          following tasks: 1) decide on the level of background              
          contamination and subtract that off the given rate level.          
          Background is to be determined from context and from making        
          use of sector 8 rates (sector 8 has a 2 MM al shield               
          covering it). 2) divide the background corrected rate by           
          the channel geometric factor and by the energy bandpass of         
          the channel. The geometric factor is found in entry                
          'CHANNEL_GEOMETRIC_FACTOR' as associated with each channel         
          'CHANNEL_ID'. To determine the energy bandpass, one must           
          judge the mass species of the of the detected particles            
          (for ions but not for electrons). The energy band passes           
          are given in entries 'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and            
          'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPENERGY',            
          and are given in the form 'ENERGY/NUCLEON'. For channels           
          that begin their names with the designations 'CH' these            
          bandpasses can be used on mass species that are accepted           
          into that channel (see entries                                     
          'MINIMUM_INSTRUMENT_PARAMETER' and 'MAXIMUM_INSTRUMENT_            
          PARAMETER' in table 'FPLECPCHANZ', which give the minimum          
          and maximum 'Z' value accepted -- these entries are blank          
          for electron channels). For other channels the given               
          bandpass refers only to the lowest 'Z' value accepted. The         
          bandpasses for other 'Z' values are not all known, but some        
          are given in the literature (e.g. Krimigis et al., 1979).          
          The final product of these instructions will be the                
          particle intensity with the units:                                 
          counts/(cm**2.str.sec.keV). Some channels are subject to           
          serious contaminations, and many of these contaminations           
          cannot be removed except with a region-by-region analysis,         
          which has not been done for this data. Thus, to use this           
          data it is absolutely vital that the contamination types           
          ('CONTAMINATION_ID' , 'CONTAMINATION_DESC') and the levels         
          of contamination ('DATA_QUALITY_ID' corresponding to the           
          definitions 'DATA_QUALITY_DESC') be carefully examined for         
          all regions of study. A dead time correction procedure has         
          been applied in an attempt to correct the linear effects of        
          detector overdrive (Pulse-Pileup). This procedure does not         
          fix severely overdriven detectors. A procedure is available        
          for correcting Voyager 2 LECP electron contamination of low        
          energy ion channels, but its effectiveness has been                
          evaluated only for the Uranus data set. Thus, corrections          
          have been applied only to the Uranus data set.

          At all times during this planetary encounter there exist           
          data in this data set that can be rated with the highest           
          confidence level. However, some of the channels of data are        
          contaminated by various kinds and various levels of                
          contaminations. It is therefore imperative, in using this          
          data set, that the contamination tables within the catalog         
          be examined. Also, not all kinds of contamination have been        
          fully documented. when in doubt the data supplier must be          
          contacted."
