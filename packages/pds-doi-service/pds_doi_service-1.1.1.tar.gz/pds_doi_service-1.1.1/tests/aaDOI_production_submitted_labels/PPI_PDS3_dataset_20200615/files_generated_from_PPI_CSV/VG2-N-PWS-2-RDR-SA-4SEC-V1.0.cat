    This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field            
    intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver (PWS) spectrum        
    analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Neptunian magnetosphere.         
    For each 4-second interval, a field strength is determined for each       
    of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range       
    from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically             
    spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated       
    with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the             
    beginning of the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second          
    spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the           
    gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or         
    more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements         
    are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not calibrated.  The data           
    numbers in this data set can be plotted in raw form for event             
    searches and simple trend analysis since they are roughly                 
    proportional to the log of the electric field strength.                   
    Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use with this          
    data set;  the use of these is described below.

      CDMAKE is primarily a data format translation routine which is used     
      to convert Voyager Plasma Wave Spectrometer (PWS) MSF tape files to     
      CD files.  The MSF, or Master Science Files, are produced at the        
      University of Iowa as the primary, ordered, full-information PWS        
      spectrum analyzer data set.  The CD files contain uncalibrated,         
      full-resolution PWS data with minimal ancillary data in a               
      simplified format which may be used in CDROM production.

    Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                     
    -------------------------------------                                     
      The Voyager PWS calibration tables are given in two plain ASCII         
      text files named VG1PWSCL.TAB and VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyagers-1 and      
      -2, respectively).  These provide information to convert the            
      uncalibrated `data number' output of the PWS 16-channel spectrum        
      analyzer to calibrated antenna voltages for each frequency channel.     
      These calibration files are always provided with the dataset when       
      the data are extracted from PDS by a user. Following is a brief         
      description of these files and a tutorial in their application.         
                                                                              
      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the      
      corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16              
      frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each line             
      contains calibrations for successive data number values ranging         
      from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually represents the lack of     
      data since the baseline noise values for each channel are all above     
      that.)                                                                  
                                                                              
      A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a data      
      structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to obtain the        
      appropriate voltage for a given data number and frequency channel.      
      For example, the following VAX FORTRAN code may be used to load a       
      calibration array for Voyager 2 PWS:

      Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency            
      channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage would       
      be given by the following array reference:                              
                                                                              
      'volts = cal (ichan, idn)'                                              
                                                                              
      This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by             
      dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07m. That         
      is:                                                                     
                                                                              
      'efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07'                                       
                                                                              
      Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of        
      the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the      
      corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                                
                                                                              
      'specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)'                
                                                                              
      Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral            
      density by the impedance of free space in ohms:

      Of course, for a particular application, it may be more efficient       
      to apply the above conversions to the calibration table directly.

      A failure in the Voyager 2 Flight Data System which occurred about 3    
      months after launch has adversely affected the calibration of PWS       
      channels 9 through 16.  An algorithm has been devised to partially      
      correct for this failure, and has proven useful for Voyager 2           
      Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune encounters, but is not valid       
      for Earth-Jupiter cruise and may be modified in the future. The         
      following implementation of this correction algorithm in VAX            
      FORTRAN assumes that uncalibrated data numbers are stored in a          
      16-element integer array, idn, with the array index equal to the
