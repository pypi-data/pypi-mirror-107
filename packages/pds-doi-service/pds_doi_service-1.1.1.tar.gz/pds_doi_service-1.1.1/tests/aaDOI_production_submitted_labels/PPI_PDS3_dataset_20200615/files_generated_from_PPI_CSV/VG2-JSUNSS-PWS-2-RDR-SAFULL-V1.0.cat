    This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data          
    from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the             
    entire mission.  Data after 2019-01-02 will be added to the archive
    on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum            
    analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases              
    before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases       
    as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.               
                                                                             
    The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 80 AU over         
    the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when

  Data Sampling                                                              
  =============                                                              
    This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric          
    field intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum       
    analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time              
    interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16              
    spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10        
    Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in          
    frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with           
    each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning       
    of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by          
    telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During           
    data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in        
    the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any         
    other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,         
    the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not       
    calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in         
    raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they         
    are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field                
    strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use        
    with this data set; the use of these is described below.                 
                                                                             
    For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon        
    the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine          
    the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the             
    difference in time between two records in the files.  In some            
    studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we         
    describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a        
    function of telemetry mode.                                              
                                                                             
    The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors         
    for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower          
    frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8        
    channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                   
    sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the             
    highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At        
    each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s            
    prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are            
    sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest           
    frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,        
    1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference              
    between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one             
    channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to          
    temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).           
                                                                             
    In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the            
    various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between          
    frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also         
    provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one       
    complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time          
    tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency             
    channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel              
    (channel 1).

    board in 10-bit accumulators and these 10-bit sums are downlinked.

  ===============                                                            
    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are              
    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as      
    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one           
    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds,        
    depending on telemetry mode).  The data are typically plotted as         
    amplitude vs. time for one or more of the channels in a strip-chart      
    like display, or can be displayed as a frequency-time spectrogram        
    using a gray- or color-bar to indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen     
    channels, it is usually best to stretch the frequency axis by            
    interpolating from one frequency channel to the next either linearly     
    or with a spline fit.  One must be aware if the frequency axis is        
    stretched that more resolution may be implied than is really             
    present.  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII         
    text file named VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-2).  This provides             
    information to convert the uncalibrated 'instrument data number'         
    output of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna     
    voltages for each frequency channel.  Following is a brief               
    description of this file and a tutorial in its application.              
                                                                             
    Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The columns       
    included are IDN, CHAN_01, CHAN_02, CHAN_03, CHAN_04, CHAN_05,           
    CHAN_06, ... CHAN_16.                                                    
                                                                             
    The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the       
    corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16               
    frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each line              
    contains calibrations for successive data number values ranging          
    from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually represents the lack         
    of data since the baseline noise values for each channel are all         
    above that.)                                                             
                                                                             
    A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a data       
    structure and thus provide a mapping from insturment data numbers        
    to voltages for each frequency channel.  For example, the following      
    C code may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 2 PWS:        
                                                                             
      int idn;                                                               
      double cal[256][16];                                                   
      FILE* file = fopen(''VG2PWSCL.TAB'', ''rb'');                          
                                                                             
      for(int iamp = 0; iamp &#10094; 256; ++iamp){                                 
         fscanf(file, '' %3d'', idn);                                        
         for(int ichan = 0; ichan &#10094; 16; ichan)                               
            fscanf(file, '',%8lE'', cal[iamp][ichan]);                       
      }                                                                      
                                                                             
    ( Here two single quotes, '', are use in place of double-quote           
      characters due to PDS documentation limitations. )                     
                                                                             
    Then, given an instrument data value idn for the frequency channel       
    with index, ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage          
    would be given by the following array reference:                         
                                                                             
      volts[ichan] = cal[idn][ichan];                                        
                                                                             
    This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by              
    dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.  That        
    is:                                                                      
                                                                             
      efield[ichan] = volts[ichan] / 7.07;                                   
                                                                             
    Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of         
    the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the       
    corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                                 
                                                                             
      specdens[ichan] = (efield * efield) / bandwidth[ichan];

    Voyager 2 PWS SA Data Number Correction                                  
    ---------------------------------------                                  
    A failure in the Voyager 2 Flight Data System which occurred about 3     
    months after launch has adversely affected the calibration of PWS        
    channels 9 through 16.  An algorithm has been devised to partially       
    correct for this failure, and has proven useful for Voyager 2            
    Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune encounters, but is not valid        
    for Earth-Jupiter cruise and may be modified in the future.  The         
    following implementation of this correction algorithm in C               
    assumes that uncalibrated data numbers are stored in a 16-element        
    integer array, named 'idn', with the array index equal to the PWS        
    channel number minus one:

    These correction should not be applied permanently to the Voyager 2      
    calibration table since they are valid for a limited time span and       
    may be modified in the future.  These corrections are applicable to      
    data in the UTC time ranges noted in the source comments above and       
    should be applied as if all data values are 8-bit measurements.          
    For 10-bit sums (modes CR-5A and UV-5A, i.e. TELETMETRY_MODE column      
    values 0x18 and 0x1D) data numbers must first be divided by 4, and

    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are              
    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as      
    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one           
    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds,        
    depending on telemetry mode).  Each sample is nominally an 8-bit         
    value which is roughly proportional to the log of the signal             
    strength.  In telemetry modes CR-5A and UV-5A the values are 10-bit      
    sums of 4 original 8-bit instrument samples.  Zero values indicate       
    missing samples and negative values indicate samples flagged as          
    contaminated by interference (see below).

    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          
    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         
    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured field        
    to any particular direction such as the local magnetic field or          
    direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft usually           
    remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously.          
    The only exception to this are a small number of occasions during        
    calibration turns when the modulation of the low-frequency               
    heliospheric radio emission could be used to do direction-finding        
    on the source of these emissions [GURNETTETAL1998]."

    This data set includes all available spectrum analyzer data acquired     
    during the Voyager 2 mission to date.  The data set has been cleaned     
    as well as possible for periodic noise spikes due to a stepper motor     
    operating on the LECP and a modulated grid within the PLS.  The          
    'bad' points remain in the data set as negative numbers with the         
    same absolute value as the original data point so that the point can     
    be skipped in normal data processing by testing for negative values      
    or recovered for special inspection by converting the sign back to a     
    positive one.  Other possible sources of noise which have not been       
    eliminated include random intense spikes of noise below 1 kiloHertz      
    due to the operation of attitude control thrusters.  Other randomly      
    occurring spikes or time periods of intense spikes over the entire       
    frequency range are indicative of telemetry errors.  No attempt has      
    been made to remove spikes since some could be valid data, i.e. real     
    bursts of wave activity.  The 17.8-Hz channel is sometimes               
    contaminated by interference from the PRA instrument, depending on       
    that instrument's mode.  This interference is at a relatively            
    constant level.                                                          
                                                                             
    A failure in the Voyager 2 flight data system on September 24, 1977      
    has decreased the sensitivity and the calibration accuracy of the        
    upper 8 spectrum analyzer channels (i.e. 1 kiloHertz and higher).        
    One aspect of this failure is that voltages on other inputs to a         
    multiplexer shared by the PWS upper 8 channels can affect the PWS        
    data.  Hence, if all 8 upper channels move up and down together, it      
    is likely this is a side effect of the failure and not a real effect     
    in the PWS data.                                                         
                                                                             
    An intermittent failure appeared in the Voyager 2 17.8 Hz channel        
    beginning on November 6, 1995.  The channel now exhibits three           
    states.  In the original failed state, the channel becomes very          
    noisy, outputting an abnormally large signal.  In a second failed        
    state, the output goes to zero.  However, for the majority of the        
    time since the failure, the channel outputs credible measurements in     
    the correct amplitude range.                                             
                                                                             
    Beginning in May 2001 the Voyager 2 wideband receiver began to           
    display degraded operation and by September of 2002, the receiver        
    showed virtually no response.  Attempts to playback wideband data        
    from Voyager 2 have ceased.
