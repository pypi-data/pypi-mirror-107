      version 1.0 (DATA_SET_ID = VG2-J-POS-4-48.0SEC). Version 1.1

      This data set consists of Voyager 2 Jupiter encounter                   
      ephemeris data in System III (1965) left handed coordinates             
      covering the period 1979-07-05 to 1979-08-12. Two versions,             
      both covering the same time period, but containing slightly             
      different data, are provided. One version was generated by the          
      Voyager MAG team from Voyager 2 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI          
      node using the VG2_JUP.BSP and PCK00003.TCP SPICE kernels.              
                                                                              
      Due to inaccuracies in Voyager SEDR, as well as changes in the          
      values of some key parameters (e.g. Jovian radius) the timing           
      is improved for the SPICE generated data. However, since much           
      of the original analysis was based upon the SEDR generated              
      ephemeris, this data has been included as well.

      The SPICE generated data were derived from SPICE using                  
      software that has been extensively tested. They should give as          
      accurate representation of spacecraft ephemeris as possible             
      using these kernels.                                                    
                                                                              
      Comparisons between these data and other data from previous             
      Jupiter missions should be performed with caution. Some key             
      parameters, such as the Jovian radius, have changed from                
      mission to mission. Definitions for Jupiter's spin rate and             
      the orientation of its spin-axis have also changed slightly             
      since the early Pioneer days.
