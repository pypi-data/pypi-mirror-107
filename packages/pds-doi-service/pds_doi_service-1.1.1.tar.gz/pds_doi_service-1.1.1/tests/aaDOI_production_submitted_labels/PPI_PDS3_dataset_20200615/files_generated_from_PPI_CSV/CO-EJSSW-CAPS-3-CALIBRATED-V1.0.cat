  =================                                                          
     This data set consists of all of the calibrated data from the           
     Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) on-board the Cassini spacecraft      
     during the entire Cassini mission. The following calibrated data        
     products (calculated from their corresponding uncalibrated data stets)  
     are produced:

     Ion Mass Spectrometer 'time of flight' linear electric field data       
       product (TOFLEF),                                                     
     Ion Mass Spectrometer 'time of flight' straight through data            
       product (TOFST).                                                      
                                                                             
     These data were acquired in a mix of CAPS operating modes beginning with
     the first instrument checkout in January 1999 and continuing throughout 
     the Cassini Tour, through the end of prime mission a subsequent         
     extended mission. The data set covers the time period from              
     1999-004T03:07:47 UT until 2012-154T06:11:45. Sampling rates were       
     variable and depended upon the downlink capabilities and other          
     activities on-board.                                                    
                                                                             
     For times when CAPS is not producing data due to being turned off or    
     due to communication issues, the data set will not contain data.        
     This effect can be sensor/data type specific.                           
                                                                             
     For times when CAPS is producing data that is not suitable for science  
     (for instance, mcp calibration tests, parts of the turn on sequence     
     when sensor is on but the mcp voltages have yet to be initiated) the    
     data is replaced with fill values.  If there is a record of all fill    
     that you think is scientifically interesting you should use the         
     uncalibrated data instead and confer with the CAPS PI.                  
     Likewise, if the energy table is unknown, or actuator angle is unknown  
     for the whole period of the record, then the dimensions of the data may 
     all be fill values too.  Another possibility is any dead time correction
     or cross talk correction that gave negative counts resulted in all data 
     at that energy being set to fill.                                       
                                                                             
  Parameters                                                                 
  ==========                                                                 
                                                                             
     Data Sampling                                                           
     -------------                                                           
       Data acquistion strategies varied throught the mission.  During the   
       cruise phase, the instrument was only capable of 2 distinct rates. In 
       addition, the spacecraft telemetry modes were not fully developed     
       which lead to peculiar recording strategies as well.  As the mission  
       progressed, the flight software for both the CAPS instrument and the  
       Cassini spacecraft matured.  During the Jupiter period, the spacecraft
       implemented data policing, where an instrument was assigned a data    
       allocation and the spacecraft would not record any more data from an  
       instrument who had reached their negotiated limit.  This strategy was 
       useful during the planning process, but careful control had to be     
       exercised to not run over the allocation.  Data gaps in the CAPS data 
       can come from a variety of sources:  instrument was off, specific     
       sensors were off, ground communication problems, CAPS over-allocation 
       issues, the instrument was in sleep mode for Probe activities, or     
       there was a problem with commanding on-board the spacecraft.          
                                                                             
       During the cruise phase, the average data rate for CAPS was low.  If  
       at all possible, the instrument was set to cycle between our lowest   
       rate in order to get contiguous data) and a higher rate (for higher   
       resolution data).  The combined high & low rate were designed to give 
       us the average low rate data.  This scheme did not change as we       
       entered Approach Science and Tour, but the average data rate was      
       increased.  In addition to running in survey mode, we also acquired   
       data in higher resolution modes around Magnetospheric boundaries,     
       Titan flybys, icy satellite flybys, ring & satellite campaigns, and   
       distant torus observations.  In addition, any data volume allocation  
       that was not allocated to other instruments was distributed to those  
       who could take advantage of the increase in data volume (and hence    
       data resolution).                                                     
                                                                             
       At the maximum CAPS telemetry rate of 16 kbits/s all data products    
       coming out of the science and calibration modes can be accommodated   
       without the need for compression. The exception is the compressed     
       extraction of ions by the SAM algorithm, and a semi-logarithmic       
       collapse of all data words. The collapse replaces 16-bit data words   
       stored in the DPU with 8-bit data words to be returned to Earth.  For 
       small data numbers, the 8-bit values are equal to the 16-bit values,  
       but for higher values the scale is logarithmic. A similar 32- to      
       16-bit compression is used for TOF data. As a result of this          
       compression, the uncertainty in the higher data numbers is            
       roughly +/- 0.015N rather than the statistical +/- N^(1/2).  No       
       attempt was made to carry out more exotic on-board compression        
       routines such as moment calculations or image-like compressions, with 
       the exception of a run-length compression of the sparse, IBS data.    
                                                                             
       The contents of the CAPS data products at 16 kbits/s are distributed  
       among the three sensors, the ACT and housekeeping channels as         
       indicated below.  Data products are organized along A-cycle (32.0 s)  
       boundaries. Acquisition and formation of B-cycle data products is     
       more complex than the A-cycle process: The CPU2 extracts TOF data in  
       the form of 512 channels each of ST and LEF data.  In the default     
       mode, adjacent energy steps are sampled to produce                    
       2RES x 32E x 512TOF = 32,768 words. In the standard CAPS telemetry    
       mode of 16 kbits/s, each word of B-cycle data is summed over 8        
       A-cycles, whereas for some lower rate modes it is summed over 16      
       A-cycles (i.e., the B-cycle is 8 A-cycles long for the 16 kbits/s mode
        and 16 A-cycles long for these other modes).  In the                 
       very early CAPS data, there was even a mode where it is summed over 32
       A-cycles.  Most CAPS data products are generated at lower data rates  
       by collapsing (summing) the 16 kbps data over adjacent energy,        
       elevation and/or azimuth bins. In addition, snapshots (uncollapsed    
       subsets of the 16 kbps data) may be included. The subset of data      
       included in the snapshot can be determined on the spacecraft, so that 
       the snapshot contains the peak of the velocity distribution. Leaving  
       out certain products entirely produces the smallest possible datasets.
       The modes used by the CAPS instrument were revised prior to the       
       Cassini Jupiter encounter to include 0.25, 0.5, and 1 kbps rates, in  
       addition to the original 2 and 16 kbps modes. These modes were further
       revised before reaching Saturn, to add 4 and 8 kbps modes and         
       incorporate experience from analysis of the Jupiter data. Other data  
       products that can be included as options (at the expense of sensor    
       data) are memory readout of control tables for diagnostic purposes.   
       Sequential event data that are used to verify IMS operations can also 
       be included.

  ==========                                                                 
                                                                             
    The uncalibrated counts are collected, collapsed, and compressed on board
    the spacecraft.  The data is then downlinked to the Jet Propulsion Query 
    Servers where it is queried from the server (in standard data unit       
    format, SFDU) and ingested into the CAPS oracle database and stored as   
    CCSDS packets.  From this point, the data is collected into blocks of    
    CCSDS packets which comprise an A-cycle (32 seconds) of data.  These     
    data are then decompressed into their separate sensor pieces and stored  
    as raw, decompressed counts in tables in the database.  From this point, 
    archive files are generated with the raw, decompressed counts, into      
    uncalibrated data set files.                                             
                                                                             
    These calibrated level 3 files are produced solely from those            
    uncalibrated (level 2) files, plus the addition of the yearly PDS        
    archived SPICE kernels for Cassini position/orientation.  These are often
    slightly improved from the SPICE kernels used in the uncalibrated level 2
    ANC files, as such position/orientation values are not identical, however
    the difference is minute, usually equivalent to a few milliseconds.      
                                                                             
    While spacecraft position/orientation is found via SPICE, CAPS' field of 
    view from the spacecraft body is provided by the uncalibrated ACT files. 
    From the level 2 CO_CAPS_UNCALIBRATED_DS.CAT file:                       
    &#10095; For the actuator data product (ACT), in December 2004 the position     
    &#10095; monitor became unreliable.  Based on our understanding of the          
    &#10095; position at the time the monitor failed, the actuator file was         
    &#10095; updated with an estimated value.  This estimation continued until      
    &#10095; TBD time, at which point the actuator was moved and began reporting    
    &#10095; reliable readings again. While trying to move the actuator to +90      
    &#10095; degrees on March 21, 2005, we again encountered a time period where    
    &#10095; the position was adjusted to account for the monitor reading           
    &#10095; unreliably. On May 26, 2005 at 10:00:00, the actuator position         
    &#10095; monitor was modified in the flight software to be the estimated        
    &#10095; position instead of the hardware position.  This data is also          
    &#10095; corrected before being placed into the archive file to account for     
    &#10095; any drift in the estimated position.                                   
                                                                             
    Utilizing the ACT and SPICE data, the spacecraft field of view in theta  
    and phi is provided for every level 3 record, along with transformation  
    information to get to J2000 co-ordinates or Saturn-centered              
    radial-theta-phi.

    The data are stored in multiple data files and have been organized by    
    product type.  Each file contains a maximum of 6 hours of data, with only
    4 files being generated per day per product.  These are the exact same   
    periods used for the level 2 uncalibrated files - where each uncalibrated
    file becomes a calibrated files here.  Format of the data files can be   
    found in the CAPS instrument archive specification [FURMANETAL2005].     
    The format can also be found in the .FMT files co-located with the data  
    files.

    The data are provided in the spacecraft frame.  Each record contains     
    transformation matrices to J2000, and from J2000 to Saturn centered RTP. 
    By using the first then the later one can go from the spacecraft frame to
    Saturn Centered RTP.  Velocity data is also provided.

    The idea is that all ancillary data required is given with each data     
    record.  This includes mcp or cem voltages so that one can uses these    
    at such future times that calibrations are refined.  Energy tables and   
    field of view of the sensors are provided as different dimensions of the 
    data.

      There are many gaps in the CAPS data stream and there are many         
      different sources for these gaps.  Sources of gaps are as follows:     
         a. telemety outages                                                 
         b. data policing violations (CAPS data volume higher than allocated)
         c. incorrect spacecraft data mangement commanding                   
         d. telemetry commanding during Cruise                               
         e. instrument anomalies                                             
         f. instrument modes which don't return all data products            
         g. planned instrument power-off and/or sleep periods                
      When there is no data for a time period, one of the above sources is   
      the reason behind the gap in level 2 uncalibrated data, and therefore a
      gap in level 3 calibrated data.  There is no indicator to which of the 
      sources is responsible for the gap in data coverage.                   
                                                                             
    Sensor Gains                                                             
    ------------                                                             
      Sensor gains were set for each sensor based upon calibration           
      information determined on the ground.  While in-flight, sensor         
      calibrations were performed and adjustments were made to the gain of a 
      sensor, based upon interpretation of the data by the team and the      
      leader of the sensor.  During the tour phase, calibrations were        
      performed roughly once every 50 days.  The change in gain can't be     
      tracked with the current archive data, but is done with                
      housekeeping information.                                              
                                                                             
      However, when the final units are counts per second, gains do not come 
      in to the equation.  Therefore counts per second are the preferred     
      scientific unit.  Seek help from the CAPS team for the appropriate     
      gain to use and remember to monitor the mcp/cem voltages for the       
      sensor, which are provided in each record.

    ---------                                                                
      See the level 2 uncalibrated files for anomalie information.           
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
      The main limitation to using this data set is that the data are not    
      calibrated using sensor gains and are only as good as the uncalibrated 
      data files that are their basis.                                       
      Do keep an eye on what energies are being scanning and if the mcp      
      voltages are stable and at nominal values in your regions of interest. 
      If a record contains nothing but fill values in the DATA object there  
      a reason it was excluded (likely mcp calibration tests or such), but   
      you have the option of returning to the level 2 uncalibrated data to   
      try to understand why.
