  =================                                                          
    This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded by         
    the Fluxgate Magnetometer on board the Pioneer 11 spacecraft,            
    during the Jupiter encounter period. Data include 36 second              
    averages of the magnetic field in RJ spherical coordinates and           
    spacecraft trajectory data in System III (1957.0), west longitude.       
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data                                                                       
  ====                                                                       
                                                                             
    Data Sampling

      These data are provided in 36 second averages. The resolution from     
      which the averages were generated is unknown. The fluxgate             
      magnetometer data is multiplexed into one of the Science Subcom        
      formats available on the spacecraft. Two separate 6-bit words per      
      subcom cycle are assigned to the instrument and thus 3 complete        
      cycles are required to read out the contents of the output buff.       
      At a bit rate of 2048 bps, a complete subcom cycle requires 6          
      second and a vector measurement is obtained approximately every 18     
      to 24 second depending on the actual roll rate of the spacecraft,      
      which is nominally 5 revolutions per minute [ACUNA&NESS1974].

    System III (1957.0) is a planetographic spherical coordinates.           
    In this system, the Jovian rotation period is defined to be              
    9h55m29.37s and the Central Meridian Longitude is defined at             
    00:00 UT on January 1, 1957.                                             
                                                                             
    RJ coordinates is based on two principle directions, Jupiter to          
    Pioneer 11, R, and Jupiter spin axis, J. X=R points away from            
    Jupiter. Y is a vector in the direction of J cross R. Z is X             
    cross Y. Radial direction, R points away from Jupiter, polar             
    direction, THETA is positive northward, and azimuthal direction,         
    PSI, parallel to the X-Y plane, positive eastward.                       
                                                                             
                                                                             
    Instrument Calibration                                                   
    ======================                                                   
    The fluxgate magnetometer was calibrated at the GSFC Magnetic            
    Test Facility by means of a 2 meter diameter, single axis                
    Helmholtz coil system. Typically hysteresis observed after               
    exposure to 2.5 mT fields was less than 1 part in 10**3 (one             
    count). Temperature stability is better than +/-0.5% over the            
    temperature range of -20 to +40 degree Celsius in spite of the           
    open loop design of the instrument. This is due to the fact              
    that the characteristics of the magnetic material used in the            
    sensor cores are fairly independent of temperature over the              
    indicated range. The stability figure includes the A/D converter         
    drift and a large portion of it is due to the single ramp design         
    of the latter. Nevertheless, minimum power consumption                   
    requirements and flight qualified component availability                 
    precluded the used of more stable A/D converter designs
