    The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) Langmuir Probe proxy    
    electron density data set contains electron densities derived using an   
    empirical relation between the floating  potential and electron densities
    from the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer during the entire Cassini mission.  
    This dataset also includes the spacecraft potential which can be derived 
    from the floating potential. This particular data set includes spacecraft
    event time, floating potential, spacecraft potential, and electron number
    density.  Data are presented in ASCII text tables of fixed-length records
    for ease in data handling.

    This data set comprises spacecraft event time, floating potential,       
    spacecraft potential, and electron number density that were derived from 
    RPWS measurements.                                                       
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Processing                                                                 
  ==========                                                                 
    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of software  
    programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw telemetry      
    packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were compressed by 
    one of a number of compression algorithms by the RPWS flight software    
    onboard, apply conversion lookup tables or algorithms to convert         
    telemetry data numbers into physical units, and make any corrections     
    required.  See chapters 5-11 of the RPWSCAL document in the DOCUMENT     
    directory for details on how the data included in this data set were     
    calibrated.  These data are calibrated using the best calibration tables 
    and algorithms available at the time the data were archived.  Should a   
    significant improvement in calibration become available, an erratum will 
    be noted in the erratum section.  Later versions of  the products may    
    contain better calibrations.  The floating potential (Ufloat) is directly
    measured by the Langmuir Probe.  The spacecraft potential Usc is derived 
    from the floating potential Ufloat using the formula:                    
                                                                             
 Usc = Ufloat / (1-(5/6)*exp(ds/D))                                          
                                                                             
    where ds is LP distance from spacecraft, 150cm, D is the Debye length in 
    centimeters calculated from D = 6.9 * sqrt(Te*11600/Ne), Ne is proxy     
    electron density in cm**-3, and we assume Te, magnetospheric electron    
    temperature to be 100eV.                                                 
                                                                             
    The proxy electron density is determined by an empirical relation found  
    between Ufloat and the electron density measured by the CAPS electron    
    spectrometer as described in MOROOKAETAL2009.

    The archived data are the results of applying the above derivation of the

    LP measurement of the floating potential, presented as ASCII tables as a

    The data in this data set are floating and spacecraft potentials and a   
    proxy for the electron density measured by the RPWS Langmuir probe.  The 
    floating potential is corrected with spacecraft attitudes so that it     
    represents the value in the LP sunlit condition.  If desired, the SPICE  
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the spacecraft
    frame to virtually any frame which  may be of use in analyzing these     
    data.  However, for most purposes, the parameters may be considered point
    measurements at Cassini  (they are at most 0.5s long) and may be entirely
    adequate with no coordinate transformations at all.

    This data set contains floating and spacecraft potentials and a proxy for
    the electron density acquired by the Cassini RPWS instrument for the     
    interval described below.  Every effort has been made to ensure that all 
    data returned to JPL from the spacecraft are included and that the       
    calibration is accurate.  Electron densities will not be available for   
    number densities above 5 cm**-3.  The accuracy of the electron densities 
    depends on the scatter in the Ufloat-to-density relation and in the      
    accuracy of the CAPS electron densities, themselves.  The absolute       
    accuracy of the electron density is likely 50% (factor of 2) but the     
    relative density from time-to-time is likely reliable.  See              
    MOROOKAETAL2009 for a discussion of the electron density accuracy.

    The RPWS Langmuir proxy electron density data will be reviewed internally
    by the Cassini RPWS team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will  
    also be peer reviewed by the PDS.

    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our         
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general, the       
    RPWS/LPR instrument was operated continuously most of the time from SOI  
    and forward, and gave higher resolution data during each moon flyby. Data
    gaps are due to spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply to downlink gaps,
    some of which were imposed by limitations on DSN station availability.   
                                                                             
    The floating potential measurements are made with variable cadence       
    through the entire mission at Saturn.  This data set presently includes  
    data through day 234 of 2010. Later measurements will be added at a later
    date.                                                                    
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
    Occasional RPWS Langmuir probe voltage sweeps have interference in       
    individual sweep samples.  These samples have been filtered away before  
    analysis and should not pose a problem for the delivered output          
    parameters.  The Ufloat proxy method for this data set is applicable only
    for densities below 5 cm**-3.  To avoid uncertainty of the transition    
    region, data are limited to radial distance beyond 7 Rs from Saturn and  
    absolute magnetic latitude above 15 degrees.  Also the data inside 10 Rt 
    from Titan are not included for the same reason.  The proxy method uses  
    the photoelectron condition directly measured by the instrument and      
    therefore not available when LP is totally in shadow.
