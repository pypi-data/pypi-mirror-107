  ==========                                                                 
    This data set comprises time series of data numbers related to the       
    potential difference at the preamp input to the RPWS.  The data          
    numbers can be calibrated with the use of supplied algorithms and        
    calibration factors to generate a time series of electric or             
    magnetic field waveforms in units of volts/meter or nanotesla.           
    Because the primary purpose of the WFR is to support wave-normal         
    analyses, the typical configuration of this receiver uses the            
    5-sensor combination mentioned above.  The waveforms can be acquired     
    in one of two modes:                                                     
                                                                             
    1.  2.5-kHz mode: 0.003 - 2.5 kHz, 140 microsecond sampling rate         
    2.  26-Hz mode: 1 - 26 Hz, 10 msec sampling rate                         
                                                                             
    For each mode, one, two, three, or five individual sensors can be        
    selected.  The samples are made simultaneously on each of the            
    sensors so as to preserve information on the phase relationships         
    between signals on the various sensors.                                  
                                                                             
    Typically, data are acquired in time series with length of a             
    multiple of 512 12-bit samples, usually with this length set to 2048     
    samples.  For the 2.5-kHz mode, this results in time series of           
    duration about 287 msec and for the 26-Hz mode, the duration of the      
    waveform series is typically about 20 s.  A new waveform series can      
    be acquired as often as once per approximately 20 seconds but            
    typically once every several minutes.  Hence, the duty cycle for         
    this mode can be very small (e.g. 287 msec out of 300 sec or about       
    0.1 percent for the 2.5 kHz mode or about 7 percent for the 26-Hz        
    mode) with typical sample lengths.  In some instrument modes the WFR     
    is exercised at a much higher duty cycle, at rates of once or twice      
    per minute, improving the duty cycle considerably.                       
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Processing

    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets and de-compress the data that       
    were compressed by one of several possible onboard compression           
    schemes.  These data may be calibrated using supplied calibration        
    factors and algorithms as well as sample code provided.

    The RPWS full resolution waveform data set is organized by receiver      
    mode and time series sample length in order to use files with fixed      
    record lengths. Each time series is a record in a file with header       
    information on time, sensor, and receiver gain (required for             
    calibration).  Separate files will be maintained for each instrument     
    mode and sample length.

    Ancillary data included with this data set collection include a          
    series of files that describe the modes of the RPWS as a function of     
    time and provide a time- ordered listing of Instrument Expanded          
    Block (IEB) trigger commands (the mode by which the RPWS is              
    reconfigured).  Also a detailed description of each of the modes (or     
    IEBs) is provided.                                                       
                                                                             
    Other data which are ancillary to this data set but which are            
    archived separately from this collection are the Navigation and          
    Ancillary Information Facility's SPICE kernels describing the            
    position and attitude of Cassini and various solar system bodies as      
    a function of time.

    The data in this data set are measurements of wave electric and          
    magnetic fields measured by the RPWS electric and magnetic sensors.      
    These fields are presented as detected by the sensors and are not        
    rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE          
    kernels can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the           
    spacecraft frame to virtually any frame which may be of use in           
    analyzing these data.  However, for many purposes, the wave              
    amplitudes are extremely useful and may be entirely adequate with no     
    coordinate transformations at all.  Wave normal analysis typically       
    requires that the wave data and vector magnetic field from the           
    MAGNETOMETER instrument be used in a common coordinate system.

    Algorithms and sample code are provided which convert from data          
    number to either electric or magnetic field strength (units of           
    volt/meter or nanotesla).  The sample code and algorithms are found      
    in the EXTRAS/SOFTWARE directory.  A description of how to access        
    and calibrate these data is included in WBRWFR.TXT in the DOCUMENT       
    directory.  Also see the RPWSCAL document in the same directory.

    This data set contains all waveform data for the Cassini RPWS            
    instrument for the interval described in the product label files.        
    Every effort has been made to ensure that all data returned to JPL       
    from the spacecraft is included and that the calibration information     
    is accurate.

    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our         
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general, these     
    data were acquired during early tour for the following intervals:

    *Actual interval for science data is much shorter than this.             
                                                                             
    Beginning in February of 2000 the instrument was operated                
    more-or-less continuously; two gaps of the order of six weeks were       
    incurred for the purposes of loading new attitude control and            
    command and data system flight software, gaps of a few days each         
    were incurred approximately twice per year because of Huygens Probe      
    testing, and gaps of several days in duration occurred during solar      
    conjunction periods prior to 2002. Remaining gaps are due to             
    spacecraft anomaly resolution or simply to downlink gaps, some of        
    which were imposed by limitations on DSN station availability.           
    During the time interval after February 2002, the wideband data were     
    acquired during such times when the onboard solid state recorder and     
    the downlink capability could support the high data volumes required     
    for these data.  Typically, waveform data are not acquired during        
    the interplanetary cruise phase.  However, they are acquired more        
    regularly at low duty cycles during tour and near some of the            
    planetary flybys en route.  A user would find events of interest in      
    the more continuous low rate data and consult the ancillary sequence     
    information provided to determine the existence of waveform data in      
    an appropriate mode for that event.  Further, a graphical browse         
    data set is supplied with the archive to allow the user to look at       
    frequency-time spectrograms directly in order to find events or          
    phenomena of interest.  This browse system will point the user to        
    the data files containing the data of interest.                          
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Limitations                                                                
  ===========                                                                
    Beginning approximately with Saturn orbit insertion in early July        
    2005, the RPWS has shown increasing sensitivity in its electric          
    field measurements below 2 kHz to interference from the spacecraft       
    reaction wheels.  The wheels are a source of electromagnetic             
    interference in the magnetic channels at frequencies directly            
    related to the rotation rate of the wheels due to a residual             
    magnetic moment in the wheels.  This level was predicted before          
    launch and has been basically constant through flight.  However, at      
    the earliest opportunity to observe the interference of the wheels       
    on the electric field measurements, there was essentially no             
    detectable level of interference.  However, after orbit insertion,       
    it became clear with increasing time that the wheels were becoming       
    an increasing source of interference in the electric field               
    measurements at about 2 kHz and below.  As of late 2005, the             
    amplitude of this interference is of the order of 30 or 40 dB above      
    the instrument  noise level.  The relation of the frequency of the       
    electric interference to the rotation rate of the wheels is less         
    direct than for the magnetic interference.  There is a general           
    correspondence, but not in detail.  It appears that there are some       
    frequencies more susceptible to the interference than others and         
    when the wheel speed approaches these 'resonances', the interference     
    becomes more visible.  A working model for this interference             
    proposes that radiation effects on some part(s) of the spacecraft,       
    perhaps the thermal blankets, reduce the conductivity.  Small            
    vibrations of this part(s), then, with some residual differential        
    charging then result in the electric field interference.  This model     
    is not confirmed and the true explanation of the interference is         
    unknown, but the effects significantly complicate the interpretation     
    of the electric field spectrum below 2 kHz.

    were processed using invalid SPICE spacecraft clock kernels.             
    Specifically the SCLKs which spice was asked to convert to SCETs         
    were outside the valid correlation region.  The error was subtle at      
    first but continued to grow as SCLKs further from the correlated         
    region were converted to SCETs.  The net result was that incorrect       
    SCET values were placed into the product files and product label         
    files for these dates.  The issue has been corrected and no longer       
    affects any CORPWS datasets available from the PDS.  The following       
    table lists the maximum SCET errors by date.
