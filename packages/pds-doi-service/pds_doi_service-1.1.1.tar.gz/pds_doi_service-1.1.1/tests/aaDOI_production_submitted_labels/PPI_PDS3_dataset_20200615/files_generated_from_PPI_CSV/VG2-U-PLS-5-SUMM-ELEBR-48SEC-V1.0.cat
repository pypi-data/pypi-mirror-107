          subset of the data set VG2-U-PLS-5-RDR-ELEFIT-48SEC which           
          should be obtained before this data is used, since it

          contamination of the data. Spacecraft charging may result           
          in underestimation of thermal electron density in some              
          regions. The first six columns are the time tag (year, day,         
          hour, min, sec, msec), columns 7 and 8 are the total moment

          density and temperature of the thermal electron component,          
          and 11 and 12 are the moment density and temperature of the         
          suprathermal electrons. Each row has the format

          This data set provides an estimate of the electron                  
          parameters in the PLS energy range (10-5950 eV). The                
          thermal electron parameters may be underestimated in some           
          regions due to negative spacecraft charging which is not            
          corrected for. Electron parameters may also be unreliable           
          between 1736 and 1854 scet on Jan 24 where electron                 
          temperatures are below the instrument energy threshold.             
          Between 1920 and 2150 scet on Jan 24 the spacecraft had a           
          large (several hundred volt) negative potential, so                 
          electron parameters in this region should also be treated           
          with caution. The instrument threshold for detecting                
          electrons is a density of about 0.001 cm-3. At times when           
          the density is near this value all derived parameters are           
          suspect. From 1621 to 1649 on Jan. 24 sunlight created an           
          artificial signal so this data should be discarded. The             
          LECP stepper motor is also creates a spurious signal in the         
          PLS detector."
