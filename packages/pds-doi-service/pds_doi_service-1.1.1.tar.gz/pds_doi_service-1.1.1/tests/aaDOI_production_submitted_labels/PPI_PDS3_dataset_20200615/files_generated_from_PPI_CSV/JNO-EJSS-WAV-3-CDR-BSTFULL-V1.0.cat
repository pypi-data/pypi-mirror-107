      Data Set Overview
      =================
      The Juno Waves calibrated burst waveform full resolution data set
      includes all high rate science electric field waveforms from 50Hz up to
      45.25 MHz and magnetic field waveforms from 50Hz to 20kHz with sample
      rates that depend on the receiver used to obtain the waveforms.  This
      is the complete waveform data set containing all high rate binning mode
      data and record mode data received from Waves from launch until the end
      of mission including initial checkout, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter
      orbits and cruise.

      Data are acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High
      Frequency Receiver (HFR) and are typically losslessly compressed on 
      board.  These data are presented in binary SERIES objects.  This data
      set comprises highest temporal resolution data obtained by Waves (or all
      other Juno instruments, for that matter).  Pre-rendered spectrograms
      generated from these data are included as well to provide the user with
      a quick view of the content of the data.  This data set should be among
      the last used of any in the Waves archive as it provides highly detailed
      information on very short isolated intervals in time.  The Waves full
      resolution survey data provide context for these data.
      

      Parameters
      ==========
      This data set consists of calibrated electric and magnetic field
      waveforms obtained in the following manner:

        1.  Magnetic field waveforms from the LFR receiver B Channel
            sampled at a rate of 50 ksps with 16 bit resolution.

        2.  Electric field waveforms from the LFR receiver Lo-E Channel
            sampled at a rate of 50 ksps with 16 bit resolution.

        3.  Electric field waveforms from the LFR receiver Hi-E Channel
            sampled at a rate of 375 ksps with 16 bit resolution.

        4.  Electric field waveforms from an HFR receiver Baseband Channel
            with a sample rate of 7 Msps with 12 bit resolution.

        5.  Electric field waveforms from an HFR receiver Paired-Mixer 
            Channel in a selected 1-MHz bandwidth sampled at a rate of 
            1.3125 Msps with 12 bit resolution.
   
      Each set of waveforms are sampled regularly at the rates stated above
      to comprise a series of samples of at least 1024 samples.  Series
      length may vary by instrument mode, compression efficiency and for
      other reasons.  Because of telemetry limitations, none of the receivers
      is the sampling continuous in time.  After a 1024 sample collection,
      there will be a time gap of a fraction of a second or more.  These gaps
      are important to understand should the data be Fourier transformed, as
      including the gaps in a Fourier transform will introduce artifacts into
      the resulting spectrum.

      Electric Antenna Length
      -----------------------
      Note that the electric field measurements are calibrated using an
      effective antenna length of 2.41 m based on the geometry of the
      deployed, physical antenna elements.  We caution the user to be aware of
      section 5.1.1 in Kurth et al. (2017) {the Space Science Reviews
      instrument description} in which the effective electrical antenna length
      is 1.46 m based on Sampl et al. (2016).  The reference then mentions the
      additional capacitive divider effect that can reduce this to 0.58 or
      even 0.46 m, depending on the value of the total base capacitance, which
      is not well known. This means that the calibrated electric field 
      strengths could be underestimated by a factor of about 5, or spectral
      densities could be underestimated by a factor of ~25.

      
      Processing
      ==========
      Data products for this data set were generated by the CDR data 
      production pipeline as described in section 3.3.2 of the VOLSIS document
      found under the DOCUMENTS sub directory.  The inputs to the processing
      are:

        1.  Science and housekeeping packets from the Waves Level 2 data
            set.

        2.  Calibration tables located on this volume.

        3.  NAIF Juno mission SPICE kernels.

        4.  A listing of mission phase names and orbit number by UTC.

      The result of the processing is one file per receiver band per burst
      interval.
   
      The WAVES_CAL document in the DOCUMENT directory provides details of
      the calibration process.  These data are calibrated using the best
      calibration tables and algorithms available at the time the data were
      archived.  Should a significant improvement in calibration become
      available, an erratum will be noted in the erratum section.  Initial
      calibrations of the electric field waveforms from an HFR receiver
      in a selected 1-MHz bandwidth (data set 5 above) are currently being 
      reanalyzed and improved.  Later versions of the products will contain
      better calibrations.

      The calibration for these data are performed, basically, by applying a
      multiplicative factor to the waveform based on the receiver gain 
      (including any gain/attenuation settings) at the center of the receiver
      band.  An alternate method of calibrating these data is to Fourier 
      transform the data, apply the frequency response of the receiver 
      (convoluted with the preamp, where necessary), apply the gain factor,
      and then perform an inverse Fourier transform.  The information
      required to perform this type of calibration, starting from the EDR
      data set is provided in the calibration documentation on this volume,
      however, it is not the intention of the Waves team to archive data using
      this calibration method.
     

      Data
      ====
      The Waves calibrated burst waveform data set includes files from each
      of the receiver/sensor combinations from which there are waveform data
      for the burst interval.  These include magnetic field waveforms the
      LFR-LO receiver, and electric field waveforms from both the LFR-LO and
      LFR-HI, the baseband of an HFR as well as one or more of the upper
      spectrum paired-mixer bands of an HFR.   Each file contains a fixed
      number of fields containing the measurement initiation times by
      spacecraft clock and UTC, a flag to indicate the employment of on-board
      noise mitigation techniques, a column indicating the count of data
      samples (as opposed to fill) in the row, as well as one field, with an
      item for each waveform sample.
      
      Ancillary Data
      ==============
      Ancillary data included with the data set collection include a series
      of files that describe the Waves operating modes as a function of
      time and provide a time-ordered listing of the Instrument Expanded
      Block (IEB) trigger commands (WAV_MAJOR_MODE) (the mode by which Waves 
      is reconfigured).  Also a detailed description of each of the modes
      (or IEBs) is provided.
      
      Other data which are ancillary to this data set, but which are archived
      separately from this collection are the Navigation and Ancillary 
      Information Facility's SPICE kernels describing the position and
      attitude of Juno and various solar system bodies as a function of time.
      
      
      Coordinate Systems
      ==================
      The data in this data set are measurements of electric and magnetic
      field waveforms measured by the Waves electric and magnetic sensors.
      These fields are presented as detected by the sensors and are not
      rotated into any other coordinate system.  If desired the SPICE kernels
      can be used with the SPICE toolkit to convert from the spacecraft frame
      to virtually any frame which may be of use in analyzing these data.
      However, for many purposes, because of the broad beam of the dipole-like
      sensors, the waveforms are extremely useful and may be entirely
      adequate with no coordinate transformations at all.
      
      
      Software
      ========
      TBD - We may include software to output these data as ASCII comma
            separated values.
      
      
      Media/Format
      ============
      This data set is provided to the Planetary Data System electronically
      as part of a volume level 'tarball' file, though the standards for file
      names, directory names and path lengths follow the guidelines provided
      in the 'Planetary Data System Standards Reference', version 3.8, under
      section 10.1.3, 'Specification for Files Delivered Electronically'.

      The 'tarball' file contains all files for a release of this volume in a
      single GNU Tar file that has then been compressed via the GNU gzip
      utility.  The tar file preserves the relative directory path for each
      file so when unpacked the original volume directory structure is
      recreated.  See Section 4 of the VOLSIS for more details on the data
      transfer methods."

      
    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE   = "
    
    
      Confidence Level Overview
      =========================
      This data set contains all calibrated waveform data for the Juno Waves
      instrument for the interval defined by the  START_TIME and STOP_TIME
      elements above.  Every effort has been made to ensure that all data
      returned to the ground from the spacecraft are included and that the
      calibration is accurate.  
      
      This section will be updated with information on known issues with the
      data, such as interference from other spacecraft systems, or other
      information needed to use the data with confidence.
      

      Review
      ======
      The Waves calibrated burst waveform data will be reviewed internally by
      the Juno Waves team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will also
      be peer reviewed by the PDS.
           
      
      Data Coverage and Quality
      =========================
      TBD

      
      Limitations
      ===========
      Waves amplitude data from the upper bands of the high frequency
      receivers are not collected via a direct sampling of the electric field
      in time.  Since the A/D converters employed in the instrument are not
      capable of sampling at the rates needed for direct measurements, the
      incoming 'real-world' signal has been mixed with the output of a local
      oscillator.  The down-mixed, in-phase and quadrature signals are then
      sampled at a fixed 1.3125 MHz rate, regardless of the band of interest.
      This produces a set of waveforms with ambiguous frequency components.
      Since a simple Fourier Transform of these time domain data will *not*
      produce a meaningful spectra we have converted these waveform data
      into spectra with unambiguous frequency components.  These products
      have the filename pattern: 

        WAV_yyyydddThhmmss_E_NBS_qqq_Vnn.DAT

      and contain electric field amplitudes versus frequency.  Here the
      parameter 'qqq' can read either 'REC' or 'BST'.  In this case
      the first amplitude of each row is *not* a DC component.  Rather these
      spectra comprise a roughly 1 MHz band centered on the frequency of the
      local oscillator used to down-mix the signal to a measurable range.
      This center frequency can change from row to row in an attempt to track
      the electron cyclotron frequency.  Appendix C in the
      DOCUMENT/VOLSIS/VOLSIS.HTM document provides more information on how
      spectra are derived from the down-mixed waveforms.

      The instrument response across the 1 MHz band is not flat, however 
      applying frequency corrections artificially inflates background noise 
      levels within the receiver to the point that these artificial data
      exceed the real signal level in many cases.  Thus frequency corrections
      have not been applied to these products.  Persons wishing to apply such
      correction may use the calibration file:

      WAV_CAL_BST_NBS_FREQ_Vnn.CSV

      to normalize the response across the 1 MHz band with the response at
      a calibrated frequency.
