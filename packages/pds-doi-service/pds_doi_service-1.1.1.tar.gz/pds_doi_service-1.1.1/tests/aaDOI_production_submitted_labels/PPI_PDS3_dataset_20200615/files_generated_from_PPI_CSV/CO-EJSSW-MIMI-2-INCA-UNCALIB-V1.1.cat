    INCA PULSE HEIGHT ANALYSIS measurement data for a statistically select   
    sample of the particle measurements. The standard product ID's are:

    INCA Image Data - count rates binned into a maximum of a 64x64           
                      geometrical grid as an image, for various particle     
                      velocities.                                            
    INCA Pulse Height Analysis Data - Statistically sampled set of           
                                      discrete particle measurements.        
                                                                             
    The data is organized in time by the spin of the spacecraft.  When the   
    spacecraft is in staring mode then the MIMI DPU automatically creates    
    a virtual spin that divides the time collection periods into 16          
    sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16 microsectors and maintains a simple       
    organizational structure for characterizing the collection of the time   
    into time segments.  When the spacecraft is spinning at a minimally      
    defined spin rate (adopted by the MIMI DPU) then the MIMI data is        
    automatically segregated into 16 sectors, 16 subsectors, and 16          
    microsectors.  When the spacecraft is spinning and the LEMMS             
    instrument is rotating the LEMMS rotation period is synchronized to      
    the spacecraft spin period so that there are 16 sectors in a spin, 16    
    subsectors in a sector and 16 microsectors in a subsector.  The CHEMS    
    and INCA instrument collection times are then also keyed to these        
    values.                                                                  
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Processing

    Data in this data set were processed by the use of a number of           
    software programs which assemble segmented mini-packets in the raw       
    telemetry packets into complete sets, de-compress the data that were     
    compressed by one of a number of compression algorithms by the MIMI      
    flight software onboard and organize the channel data into               
    appropriate time segments. Images are preprocessing into appropriate     
    arrays on board the spacecraft. This preprocessing software              
    also includes algorithms to handle the various spacecraft rotation       
    modes.

           Notes regarding the SCLOCK value:                                 
           1.  Only the SCLOCK major segment value is provided - MIMI        
               currently does not have access to the fine SCLOCK value       
               hence SCLOCK resolution is limited to +- 1/2 SCLOCK count     
           2.  The SCLOCK is only available from telemetry at the            
               beginning of each spin. All other published SCLOCKS are       
               derived from the spin starting SCLOCK, the spin numbers       
               (for the current and next available spins), and the spin      
               period.                                                       
           3.  SCLOCK values are assumed to drive the value of the           
               ephemeris times and not vice-versa. All effort is made to     
               validate the published ephemeris times but since updates to   
               the Cassini SCLOCK kernel in SPICE can occur the values of    
               ephemeris time are only as accurate as the currently          
               published Cassini SCLOCK SPICE kernel.

    signal; time is the count of events with both a Start fast and a Stop    
    fast; Events received is the number of valid events sent to the DPU,     
    and processed counts are the number the DPU sends inot image bins.       
    These latter two may be different because of additional valid event      
    criteria imposed by the DPU, and/or inability of the DPU to process      
    all of the events it receives.)

    representing the MIMI Key Parameter (KP) data.  The MIMI KP data is a    
    calibrated subset of the important channels for each of the MIMI         
    detectors.  The subset of channels have been identified to most          
    reasonably show characteristic energetic particle events during the      
    mission.  The KP data is calculated at an arbitrarily defined 60         
    second cadence which is different than the approximate collection        
    times for the instruments as identified below for standard operations:   
    (It must be realized that the collection times vary based upon the       
    telemetry rate but nothing more than a factor of 2, 4, or 8.)

    The data in this data set are measurements of count rates based upon     
    the orientation of the INCA instrument (INCA Center look direction).     
    Particle flux effects are then determined by transforming from a         
    spacecraft centered coordinate system, properly rotated to account for   
    the appropriate INCA telescope direction, into whatever external         
    coordinate (reference system) is most appropriate.

    There is no sample software provided as of the writing of this catalog   
    file although the calibration volume does provide algorithms for

    This data set contains all calibrated data for the INCA Detector as      
    part of the Cassini MIMI instrument for the interval described above.    
    Every effort has been made to ensure that all data returned to APL       
    from the spacecraft is included and that the calibrated browse data      
    products are accurate.                                                   
                                                                             
    As of this writing there are no known issues associated with the INCA    
    detector that would limit the usability or reliability of the data.

    The MIMI INCA data will be reviewed internally by the Cassini MIMI       
    team prior to release to the PDS. The data set will also be peer         
    reviewed by the PDS.

    All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our         
    knowledge and attempts to determine completeness.  In general, the       
    instrument was operated only briefly during early tour for the           
    following intervals:

    Only data for interval 5 is provided to PDS due to technical issues in   
    processing.                                                              
                                                                             
    Beginning in February of 2000 the instrument was operated more-or-less   
    continuously with small daily runs of approximately 8 hours.             
    Intermittent data collection occurred during 2002 and 2003 with          
    multiple day gaps in the data

    On those days for which the instrument did not collect data either due   
    to the instrument being off or due to communication issues, the data     
    set will not contain any files.
