      hemispherical detectors covering 4 pi steradians and

      be consulted to find the accurate thresholds for any day of            
      the mission. A more complete description of the instrument may         
      be found in [HURLEYETAL1992] and [COTINETAL1983]. Although the         
      prime objectives of this investigation are the study of solar          
      and cosmic x- and gamma-ray bursts, it should be noted that the        
      experiment is also sensitive to solar protons and electrons.           
      The former deposit energy directly in the scintillator if they         
      are energetic enough, while the latter may produce x- radiation        
      locally by bremsstrahlung. Thus although the counting rates are        
      generally stable at about 500 c/s over the long term, there are

      Data rate changes produce short spikes in the count rates due          
      to a processing artifact. These can in principle be corrected          
      if the data are scanned and the rate changes are identified;           
      the count rate spikes can then be adjusted to their correct            
      values. There are also short (one sample long) count rate              
      dropouts, due to an artifact of the onboard software."
