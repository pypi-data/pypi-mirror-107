    This data set gives the best available values for ion densities,          
    temperatures, and velocities near Neptune derived from data               
    obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment.  All parameters are          
    obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function           
    of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a non-linear       
    least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which,        
    when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the         
    data.  The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition is       
    not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the           
    separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the          
    plasma is co-moving).  In the upstream solar wind protons are fit         
    to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain       
    accurate plasma parameters.  In the magnetosheath the ion flux so         
    low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to               
    increase the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data           
    could be reliably fit.  These averaged spectra were fit using two         
    proton Maxwellians with the same velocity. The values given in the        
    upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the                      
    density-weighted temperature.  In both the upstream solar wind and        
    magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures          
    are derived for each fit component.  In the magnetosphere spectra         
    do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors,        
    so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal.  In some cases the             
    azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid                
    corotation is assumed.  In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L&#10095;5) two            
    distinct current peaks appear in the spectra; these are fit               
    assuming a composition of H+ and N+.  In the inner magnetosphere          
    the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two          
    superimposed Maxwellians are still required to fit the data. These        
    spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+ and the        
    second with two H+ components.  The N+ composition is preferred by        
    the data provider.  All fit values in the magnetosphere come with         
    one sigma errors.  It should be noted that no attempt has been made       
    to account for the spacecraft potential, which is probably about -10      
    V in this region and will effect the density and velocity values.         
    In the outbound magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit          
    values are given for velocity, density, and thermal speed.  The           
    signal-to-noise ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near         
    the magnetopause, which can result in the analysis giving incorrect       
    values.  The L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to          
    permit accurate determinations parameters in many regions;                
    in particular the temperature and non-radial velocity components          
    may be inaccurate.

      Ion density: A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per        
      unit volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,        
      or energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or            
      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however, mass        
      and charge state are often assumed due to instrument limitations.       
                                                                              
      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.)              
      or their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                
      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will             
      be provided in a single dataset. In general, if more than one           
      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density       
      will be provided which is the sum of the ion densities. If a            
      plasma component does not have a Maxwellian distribution                
      the actual distribution can be represented as the sum of                
      several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each Maxwellian       
      is given.

      Ion temperature: A derived parameter giving an indication of the        
      mean energy/ion, assuming the shape of the ion energy spectrum to       
      be Maxwellian                                                           
      (i.e. highest entropy shape). Given that the                            
      ion energy spectrum is not exactly                                      
      Maxwellian, the ion temperature can be                                  
      defined integrally (whereby the mean energy                             
      obtained by integrating under the actual ion                            
      energy spectrum is set equal to the integral under a                    
      Maxwellian, where the temperature is a free                             
      parameter for which to solve), or differentially                        
      (whereby the slopes of the actually ion                                 
      energy spectrum at various energies are matched to                      
      the slopes of a corresponding Maxwellian). The                          
      temperature parameter is often qualified with a                         
      range of applicable energies. temperatures can be                       
      angularly anisotropic. If the ions do not                               
      have a Maxwellian distribution the actual distribution                  
      can be represented as the sum of several Maxwellians,                   
      each with a separate temperature.

      Ion thermal speed: A measure of the velocity associated                 
      with the temperature of the ions.  It is formally defined as            
      the Ion Thermal Speed squared equals two times K                        
      (Boltzmann's constant) times T (temperature of ion) divided             
      by M (ion mass). Each component of a plasma has a thermal speed         
      associated with it.                                                     
                                                                              
      Ion Current: A measured parameter equaling the rate at which positive   
      charge is collected by a particle detector. The ions                    
      contributing to this current may be restricted                          
      by energy and/or mass. Since ion charge states may be                   
      greater than one, this quantity generally is                            
      greater than the corresponding ion rate.

    Magnetospheric data can be distorted by spacecraft charge;                
    in particular values in the region 4-6 Neptune radii from                 
    the planet outbound where only the H+ plasma component                    
    was observed may be tainted by this effect. The deviation of              
    the azimuthal velocity from corotation is probably an                     
    artifact of the charging.
