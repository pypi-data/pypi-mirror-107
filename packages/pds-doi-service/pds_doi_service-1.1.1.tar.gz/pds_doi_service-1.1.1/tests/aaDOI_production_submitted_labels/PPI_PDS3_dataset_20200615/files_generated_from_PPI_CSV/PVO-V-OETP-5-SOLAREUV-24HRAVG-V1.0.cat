The Solar EUV Daily Values File.  This file gives the magnitude of the       
photoemission current from the radial probe, Ipe, (in units of 10-9 amps).   
Ipe dominates the ion current measurements outside the Venusian              
ionosphere, making possible the serendipitous measurement of the total       
solar EUV flux.  The latter is an important parameter because solar EUV is   
the main source of ionization and heating for the Venusian thermosphere      
and ionosphere.  The method is discussed by Brace et al., (1988).            
                                                                             
The pe current measurements are taken just before PVO leaves the solar       
wind and enters the magnetosheath (usually an hour or two before             
periapsis).  This approach provides the solar EUV flux that the Venus        
thermosphere received just before the periapsis measurements.  The           
maximum value of the spin modulated Ipe is taken because it corresponds      
to a probe orientation perpendicular to the Sun when the maximum area        
of the probe is exposed to the Sun.  Ipe is proportional to the intensity of 
the ionizing component of solar radiation, so it is possible to derive the   
total solar EUV (and far UV) flux.  Ly alpha contributes approximately half  
of the Ipe while nearly all of the rest is produced by radiation between 200 
A and 1200 A which ionizes, excites and dissociates thermospheric            
neutrals.                                                                    
                                                                             
This file contains the daily average value of the photoelectron emission     
current, Ipe, from the radial probe, usually measured about 1 hr before      
periapsis.  The Ipe values are given in units of 10-9 amperes.  The data     
cover the interval from 1979 through early 1992 when periapsis got low       
enough to cause photoelectric yield changes that have not been fully         
resolved and corrected for appropriately. The data provided cover orbits     
1 to 4800. After orbit 4800, when PVO began to enter the atmosphere, the     
Langmuir probe could no longer be kept clean, and as a result the yield      
changed. For further details, contact Walt Hoegy at GSFC code 914,           
(301) 286-3837 or email hoegy@mite.gsfc.nasa.gov.                            
                                                                             
The daily Ipe measurements can be converted into the total solar EUV flux    
(VEUV) using the following the equation given by Brace et al., (1988),       
                                                                             
                       VEUV = 1.53 x 1011 Ipe   (photons/cm2/s)              
                                                                             
VEUV represents the total solar flux, weighted by the known wavelength-      
dependent yield of the collector.  A standard Hinteregger solar EUV/UV       
spectrum is assumed to derive the coefficient, but the measurement is        
relatively insensitive to this assumption over the typical range of          
variations in the solar spectrum.                                            
                                                                             
The VEUV data have been useful in the study of solar EUV effects on the ion  
production and electron heating rates in the Venus ionosphere.  VEUV         
variations have been correlated with changes in the density and              
temperature of the ionosphere (Elphic et al., 1984), the height of the bow   
shock (Alexander et al., 1985, Russell et al., 1988), and changes in the     
density and temperature of the thermosphere (Mahajan et al., 1990).

The Ipe measurements themselves are made with an absolute accuracy of 1      
to 2%, depending upon where the current falls within the decade range of     
the ranging electrometer.  The absolute accuracy of the measurements is      
also limited by our knowledge of the photoelectric yield of the radial       
probe collector, and our assumption that a Hinteregger standard EUV/UV       
spectrum is correct.  We estimate a 10% absolute accuracy in the total EUV   
flux and a 1 to 2% relative accuracy or precision provided by the accuracy   
of the current measurements themselves.  See Brace et al.(1988) for
