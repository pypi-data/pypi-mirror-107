      =================                                                      
      The Ulysses spacecraft was occulted by the Io Plasma Torus             
      (IPT) during its Jupiter encounter on 8 February 1992. The             
      Ulysses dual-frequency radio subsystem used by the Ulysses             
      Solar Corona Experiment (SCE) was utilized to measure the              
      electron content (column density) of the IPT [BIRDETAL1992B].          
      In the nominal mode for radio-sounding observations                    
      [BIRDETAL1992A], both downlinks (S-band: f_s = 2.3 GHz;                
      X-band: f_x = 8.4 GHz) are phase coherent with the uplink              
      (S-band: f_u = 2.1 GHz). The dual-frequency radio-sounding             
      technique exploits the dispersive nature of ionized media on           
      the propagation of the two downlinks. The tiny Doppler shift           
      due to plasma moving in and out of the ray path is greater at          
      S-band than at the higher frequency X-band.                            
                                                                             
      The SCE data are obtained from the Radio Science Support group         
      at JPL. There are basically two types of data: Ranging and             
      Doppler (Frequency), recorded as a function of UT Ground               
      Received Time. The raw data are delivered in special binary            
      files called ATDFs (Archival Tracking Data Files), containing          
      Ranging and Doppler data from the standard DSN tracking                
      receivers. There are high-time resolution Doppler data from            
      special radio science receivers (so-called 'open loop' data)           
      as well. These are in files called ODRs (Original Data                 
      Records).                                                              
                                                                             
      ATDFs are files of radiometric data produced by the Network            
      Operations Control Center (NOCC) Navigation Subsystem (NAV).           
      They are derived from Intermediate Data Records by NAV and             
      contain all radiometric measurements received from the DSN             
      station including signal levels (`AGC' = automatic gain                
      control in dBm), antenna pointing angles, frequency (often             
      referred to simply as `Doppler'), range, and residuals.                
      Doppler data are often used to infer spacecraft radial motion          
      relative to the tracking antenna. Data values in ATDFs are             
      reported at rates no higher than 10 per second. For the                
      Ulysses Jupiter encounter the received frequencies at S-Band           
      and X-band were recorded at a sample time of one per second.           
      Each ATDF data record contains 117 parameters, stored in               
      records of 288 bytes. The ATDF is described in section                 
      TRK-2-25 of the JPL Document 820-13 [DSN820-13].                       
                                                                             
      The ATDFs have been analyzed for the Jupiter encounter and a           
      detailed report has been published [BIRDETAL1993]. Data                
      files have been generated which contain the Ranging and                
      Doppler data at various stages of processing. Stage #1 is              
      generally just stripping the Ranging/Doppler data from the             
      ATDFs. Stage #2 is to 'clean' the data files by weeding out            
      obviously bad data. Stage #3 is to produce a 'final data               
      set', a table of the measured data plus physically relevant            
      quantities as function of time.                                        
                                                                             
      Data
