    electric and magnetic wave spectra obtained during a ~ 15-minute period
    of contiguous observations near the closest approach to Ida and a number
    of non-contiguous spectra taken prior to closest approach.  In addition
    waveform survey data (uncalibrated) and all instrument housekeeping data
    are included.  The parameters provided for both the electric and magnetic
    field spectral data are uncalibrated data numbers.  Software and 
    calibration tables provided as part of this data set allow for fully
    calibrated data for the electric field measurements in raw data numbers,
    voltage at the antenna inputs (V), electric field (V/m), electric field
    spectral density (V**2/m**2/Hz), or power flux (W/m**2/Hz).  The magnetic
    field measurements can be provided in units of magnetic field spectral 
    density (nT**2/Hz).  The sources of these data are the High Frequency
    Receiver, Sweep Frequency Receiver, and Spectrum Analyzer which make up
    the Low Rate Science portion of the PWS. During the included time 
    interval, the instrument cycled between the electric and magnetic antennas
    for the Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer.  The High 
    Frequency Receiver is always connected to the electric antenna.  Hence,
    for the Sweep Frequency Receiver and the Spectrum Analyzer, the temporal
    resolution for electric measurements is basically one spectrum per 37.33
    seconds.  For the High Frequency Receiver, the time between spectra is 
    18.67 seconds.  Note that the lowest 14 High Frequency Receiver channels
    are sampled twice per 18.67 seconds while the remaining channels are 
    sampled only once.  The four Spectrum Analyzer channels are each sampled
    7 times in an 18.67 sec interval."

    The waveform survey data are generated by the wideband receiver portion of
    the Plasma Wave Instrument.  These data are 4-bit measurements of the
    voltage across the preamplifier input at a rate of 201.6 k, 25.2 k or 3.2
    k samples per second (for the 80 kHz, 10 kHz, and 1 kHz bandwidth modes,
    respectively) using either the electric dipole or magnetic search coil
    antennas.  An automatic gain control receiver is used to set the gain at
    an optimum value so as to make the best use of the limited dynamic range
    afforded by the 4-bit analog-to-digital converter.  In principle, it is
    possible to use the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) readout contained in the
    data set to calibrate this voltage, but this capability does not currently
    exist for this data set."

    CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_NOTE          = "
    This data set includes all available Low Rate Science spectrum analyzer
    data within the interval of time covered.  Included in this data set are
    data quality flags which indicate whether the parity of the data value was
    good or bad.  A bad parity flag indicates an error in the data value and
    the software provided with this data will ignore such values.  However,
    this is a simple parity scheme, hence, even numbers of bit errors will not
    be flagged as being bad.  The magnetic spectra contain narrowband
    interference lines at 2.4 kHz and harmonics.  Missing data are indicated
    by zero.  The sporadic data obtained prior to the ~15-minute period of
    continuous observations correspond to data which were played back along
    with imaging and other remote sensing information.  Due to tape recorder
    and downlink limitations, there was no attempt to make these data
    continuous and they are supplied here simply for completeness."
