MARSIS Level 1b data products consist of the data produced by the     
instrument reconstructed from the scientific telemetry, sorted by     
instrument state and data type, and provided with spacecraft position,
velocity and attitude information.

MARSIS data are organized into groups of echoes called frames. A frame
contains one or more echoes, with or without on-board processing. Each
echo, depending on the kind of processing it underwent, is recorded   
either as a time series of signal samples, or as the complex spectrum 
of the signal itself produced by means of a FFT. Scientific data in a 
frame are complemented by a set of ancillary data, produced by the    
instrument and recording parameter values used in pulse transmission, 
echo reception and on-board processing.

Level 1b processing starts by cleaning, merging and time-ordering the 
packets. Duplicate data are deleted, missing packets are padded out,  
and the data are organised by orbits. Data are then sorted by         
instrument data types and instrument modes, and provided with         
spacecraft position, velocity and attitude information.               
                                                                      
MARSIS Level 1b processing orders data in a useful way for the        
intended users (i.e. radar scientists) and applications (i.e. quick   
look to monitor hardware performance and higher-level processing),    
altering and manipulating them as little as possible to avoid the risk
of introducing errors and, at the same time, including all necessary  
information from all relevant sources. Level 1b data are in           
scientifically useful form, i.e. individual spectra, but they are     
uncalibrated.

EDR Data Products consist of two binary files, each of which contains 
a PDS binary TABLE object, and a single detached PDS label describing 
their structure. The first file, called Frame file (FRM) contains the 
instrument data proper, exactly in the same format (bit by bit) as    
they were produced by the instrument. Each frame corresponds to a     
record in the file, which is also a row in the PDS binary TABLE object
into which frames are organised.                                      
                                                                      
The second file constituting an EDR is called a Geometry file (GEO),  
and contains one record, corresponding to one line of the PDS binary  
TABLE object into which data are organised, for every frame in the    
corresponding FRM file. Columns of the table contains the values of   
parameters describing the geometry of observation for the             
corresponding frame.

interval described above. Every effort has been made to ensure that   
all data returned by the spacecraft is included and that processing is
accurate.                                                             
                                                                      
                                                                      
Review                                                                
======                                                                
                                                                      
The MARSIS EDR data have been reviewed internally by the Mars Express 
MARSIS team prior to release to the PDS. The data set has been also   
peer reviewed by the PSA.                                             
                                                                      
                                                                      
Data Coverage and Quality                                             
=========================                                             
                                                                      
All data in the stated interval are included, to the best of our      
knowledge and attempts to determine completeness. The instrument was  
operated only briefly during cruise for periodic instrument health.   
The late deployment of the MARSIS antenna allowed the start of science
operations only six months before the end of the nominal mission.     
                                                                      
Data quality in a data product label is indicated through the         
DATA_QUALITY_ID element, and measures the integrity of the telemetry  
stream from the instrument. The permitted values of DATA_QUALITY_ID   
are the following:                                                    
                                                                      
-1: percentage of corrupted data not available                        
 0: no corrupted data                                                 
 1: less than 2% corrupted data                                       
 2: less than 5% corrupted data                                       
 3: less than 10% corrupted data                                      
 4: more than 10% corrupted data
