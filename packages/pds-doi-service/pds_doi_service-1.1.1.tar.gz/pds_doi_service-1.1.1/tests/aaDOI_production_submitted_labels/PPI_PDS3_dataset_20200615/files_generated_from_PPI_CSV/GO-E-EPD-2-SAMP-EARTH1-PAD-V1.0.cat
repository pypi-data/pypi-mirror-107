  Data Set Overview
  =================
    A data file record contains a single sector's data for a particular '
    LEMMS or CMS channel.  Also included are pitch and phase angles
    of the particles counted by the detectors.  The angles are determined
    in a coordinate system defined by the magnetic field (magnetic field
    data provided by Steve Joy) and the position of Earth (calculated with
    SPICE kernel data).  The z-axis of the coordinate system points along
    the magnetic field.  The x-axis is chosen so Earth lies in the xz
    plane.  The pitch angle is the angle between the sector look direction
    and the z-axis.  The phase angle is the angle between x-axis and the
    projection of the x-axis on the xy plane.  During the encounter, the
    stepper motor was moving from position zero thru five.  Steps one
    through five are reported in this data set.  The rates reported are in
    units of counts/sec.  Pitch and phase angles are recorded in radians."
