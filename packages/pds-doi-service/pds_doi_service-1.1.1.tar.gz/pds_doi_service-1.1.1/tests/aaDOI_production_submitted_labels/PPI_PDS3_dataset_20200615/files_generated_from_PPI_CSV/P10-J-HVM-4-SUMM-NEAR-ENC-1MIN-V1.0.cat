    This data set consists of magnetic field vector data recorded by         
    the Vector Helium Magnetometer onboard the Pioneer 10 spacecraft,        
    during the close encounter to Jupiter (inside 7 RJ). The vector          
    data are provided in a Jupiter-centered JG coordinates (see              
    descriptions in Sections of Data Format and Coordinate System for        
    Data). Also included are the spacecraft trajectory data (distance        
    from Jupiter, latitude, and longitude) in the same coordinates.          
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Data Sampling

    These data are provided in 1 minute averages. The resolution from        
    which the 1 minute averages were generated is unknown. The               
    magnetometer measures the three field components over a frequency        
    range from 0 to 10 Hz. At encounter the data rate was 1024 bits/sec      
    and the magnetometer sampling rate was one vector measurement every      
    3/16 second, corresponding to 5.33 samples/sec.

    JG coordinates is defined as the X axis in the direction of G, the       
    equatorial vector lying in the System III (1957.0) Prime Meridian;       
    the Z axis in the direction of J, the spin axis of Jupiter;  and         
    the Y axis parallel to Jupiter's equatorial plane and completing         
    the right-handed orthogonal system.                                      
                                                                             
                                                                             
  Instrument Calibration                                                     
  ======================                                                     
    The in-flight calibration consists of impressing eight precisely         
    known currents on the sensor coil system and measuring the resulting     
    fields with the magnetometer. The instrument is designed to carry        
    out a nominal mission with only one instrument-on command. The           
    instrument comes on in the automatic ranging/spectrum analyzer           
    mode and automatically ranges to the proper scale by comparing           
    the +X and |Z| axis outputs with fixed reference voltages. The           
    only function commands sent to this instrument during the Pioneer        
    F&G missions were those to initiate the in-flight calibration            
    sequence periodically during the cruise phase. At the conclusion         
    of this sequence the instrument automatically returned to the            
    automatic ranging mode. A 6-bit digital house-keeping word               
    indicates the operating mode of the instrument.                          
                                                                             
    The in-flight calibration onboard the Pioneer spacecraft was done        
    by ground command once or twice a week. The low range sensors were       
    calibrated at field magnitude of 13 GAMMA and 26 GAMMA during the        
    interplanetary cruise period. While the high range sensors were          
    calibrated near planetary encounter where the field magnitude was        
    as high as +/-43,000 GAMMA and 86,800 GAMMA. There are two kind of       
    instrument calibration parameters, sensor scale factor (gain) and        
    offset.                                                                  
                                                                             
    The conventional approach to checking the magnetometer scale             
    factors in flight is to apply calibration field changes, dB to           
    the sensors so that the corresponding voltage change dV can be           
    determined. Normally several step changes are applied sequentially       
    so that the linearity can be tested directly. After two years of         
    in-flight calibrations, no change has been detected in the Pioneer       
    10 or 11 scale factors which were then known to an accuracy of           
    1 percent or better.                                                     
                                                                             
    The sensor offsets were determined in-flight using two different         
    techniques.  For the two sensors in the spin plane, the offset           
    was calculated by averaging the spinning data in a time interval         
    of an integral number of spin period. The offset of the spin axis        
    sensor was determined by an adaptation of a variance technique           
    developed by L. Davis [BELCHER1973]. The essential assumption            
    was made that over short intervals of time (5 minutes), the              
    fluctuations in the interplanetary field are principally changes         
    in direction and tend to conserve the magnitude of the field."

    The vector helium magnetometer noise spectrum is independent of          
    frequency (white) with a field equivalent power spectral density         
    of 10**-4 GAMMA**2/HZ. For signal bandwidths less than 1 Hz,             
    corresponding for example to values averaged over a few seconds          
    or more, fields smaller than 0.01 GAMMA can be detected.                 
                                                                             
    The maximum relative error of the magnetometer sensors is given by       
               dB/B &#10094;= dB0/B + dk/k                                          
    where B0 is the total offset error and dk is the scale factor error.     
    The scale factor accuracy is as good as 1%. And the total offset         
    error is mainly caused by the spin axis sensor error because it          
    is not readily determined as the two in spin-plane sensors. The          
    ratio of the standard deviation of the offset in spinning axis           
    to the field magnitude is about 0.05. Thus, the maximum relative         
    error in the magnetic field measurement is 0.06.
