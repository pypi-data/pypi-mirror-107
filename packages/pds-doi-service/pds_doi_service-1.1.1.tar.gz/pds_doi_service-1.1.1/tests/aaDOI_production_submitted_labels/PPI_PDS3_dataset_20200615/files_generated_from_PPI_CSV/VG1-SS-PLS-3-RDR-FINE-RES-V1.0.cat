      Voyager 1 plasma data of the solar wind, fine resolution data.         
The files in this directory contain the Voyager fine resolution plasma data. 
The plasma parameters are obtained by finding the best fit of a convected    
isotropic Maxwellian distribution to the data. One sigma errors              
are typically less than 0.5 percent in the speed and VR, less than 5 percent 
 for the density and thermal speed, and vary greatly for VT and VN.          
Sampling times range from 12 to 192 sec., with sampling generally more       
frequent early in the mission. The columns are:

2) day of year (day 1 is Jan. 1)                                             
3) decimal hour                                                              
4) proton speed in km/s (magnitude of V)                                     
5) proton density in cm-3                                                    
6) proton thermal speed in km/s (proton temperature in eV = .0052 times the  
                                 square of the thermal speed)

The velocity components are given in the RTN coordinate system,              
where R is radially outward, T is in a plane parallel to the solar           
equatorial plane and positive in the direction of solar rotation,            
and N completes a right-handed system.
