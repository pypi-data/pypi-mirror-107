      The SWOOPS (Solar Wind Observations Over the Poles of the Sun)         
      experiment has two electrostatic analyzers, one for positive           
      ions and one for electrons. The instrument is fully described          
      in: [BAMEETAL1992A].  The electron and ion analyzers are               
      separate instruments that operate asynchronously.                      
                                                                             
      The following publications contain descriptions of SWOOPS              
      operations and instrumental limitations at Jupiter:                    
                                                                             
      [PHILLIPSETAL1993A]                                                    
                                                                             
      [PHILLIPSETAL1993B]                                                    
                                                                             
      The electron instrument functioned well throughout the                 
      encounter, subject of course to its inherent energy                    
      limitations and to the energetic particle background present           
      in the magnetosphere.  The ion experiment, which was                   
      optimized for solar wind measurements and thus has a limited           
      field of view, produced useful measurements in the outbound            
      magnetosheath only.  A summary of the ion measurements                 
      follows:                                                               
                                                                             
      INBOUND MAGNETOSHEATH.  The look direction of the experiment           
      was ground-commanded, based on expectations of sheath flow             
      direction.  During the brief inbound sheath encounter, the             
      flow was anomalous (sunward at times). Thus the instrument             
      'missed the beam' and returned no useful measurements.                 
                                                                             
      OUTBOUND MAGNETOSHEATH.  Here the flow was more or less as             
      expected. The ion experiment captured most of the sheath flow          
      beam during most outbound sheath intervals.  The measurements          
      are shown in the sheath paper cited above.  In general, flow           
      velocities agreed with the electron velocities.  Disagreements         
      occurred when the ion sensor missed the heart of the beam.             
      Densities and temperatures were generally substantially                
      underestimated by the ion experiment due to its limited                
      angular coverage.                                                      
                                                                             
      MAGNETOSPHERE.  Due to the limited energy range and look               
      direction of the instrument, as well as the energetic                  
      particle background, the ion instrument did not return useful          
      data in the magnetosphere.                                             
                                                                             
      As a result of these problems, the SWOOPS ion observations             
      inside the Jovian bow shock are not included in the archived           
      Jupiter data.                                                          
                                                                             
      Data provided start at the beginning of day 25 (January 25,            
      1992) and run through the end of day 48 (February 17) and              
      include all bow shock and magnetopause crossings.  Both                
      experiments were shut down for a 25-hour interval surrounding          
      closest approach due to elevated penetrating background.               
                                                                             
      The interval specified by PDS for this encounter includes              
      substantial intervals of solar wind.  In general, the SWOOPS           
      ion experiment provides superior characterization of solar             
      wind density and speed in the solar wind, while the electron           
      experiment provided the only easily usable data inside the             
      Jovian bow shocks.  In order to provide the best observations          
      for each phase of the encounter, the following schemes were            
      adopted:                                                               
                                                                             
      0000 UT on Day 25 until 1200 UT on Day 33: Solar wind scheme.          
      Electron temperature, charge-weighted ion (proton + alpha)             
      density, and proton velocity.  Ion data were averaged to               
      coincide with the electron spectral times.                             
                                                                             
      1200 UT of Day 33 until 1200 UT on Day 47: Jupiter scheme.             
      Electron temperature, density, and velocity                            
                                                                             
      1200 UT on Day 47 until 2400 UT on Day 48: Solar wind scheme.          
                                                                             
      The minor plasma discontinuities occurring at 1200 UT on days          
      33 and 47 are artifacts of the switch-over between Jupiter and         
      solar wind schemes.                                                    
                                                                             
      While the solar wind ion products included in the archive are          
      created through routine data reduction, the electron                   
      parameters required unique Jupiter-specific processing.  A             
      description of the experiment and processing follows.                  
                                                                             
      INTRODUCTION TO THE SWOOPS ELECTRON EXPERIMENT                         
      ----------------------------------------------                         
      The SWOOPS electron spectrometer is a 120-degree spherical             
      section electrostatic analyzer which measures the 3-d velocity         
      space distributions of solar wind electrons.  In the mode used         
      at Jupiter, the instrumental energy range was 1.6 to 862 eV in         
      the spacecraft frame.  Since the spacecraft charged to +2 to           
      +44 volts during the encounter, 2 to 44 eV are subtracted from         
      the measured energies (electrons measured at energies below            
      the spacecraft potential are electrostatically trapped                 
      photoelectrons).                                                       
                                                                             
      Each spectrum takes 2 minutes to accumulate, but telemetry             
      takes longer. During the Jupiter encounter, spectra were               
      returned every 5.7 minutes. The analyzer uses 7 channel                
      electron multipliers (CEMs) to count electrons discretely              
      over 95% of the unit sphere in look direction.  For telemetry          
      conservation, 2 out of every 3 spectra are 'two-                       
      dimensionalized' onboard the spacecraft, that is the count             
      rates are averaged over all 7 CEMs.  These 2-d spectra thus            
      return electron counts as a function of energy and spacecraft          
      spin angle. The full 3-d spectra return counts as a function           
      of energy, spacecraft spin angle, and polar angle (measured            
      from the spacecraft spin axis, which points at Earth).  The            
      3-d spectra incorporate 32 spin-angle steps, for a total               
      spectral content of 20 energies x 32 azimuths x 7 polar                
      angles, while the 2-d spectra include 20 energies x 64                 
      azimuths x 1 angle.                                                    
                                                                             
      Processing                                                             
      ==========                                                             
      The first step in data reduction is determination of the               
      spacecraft potential. This is done by identifying inflections          
      in the angle-averaged energy spectra. While this is automated          
      in the solar wind, it was done by eye, spectrum-by spectrum,           
      for the Jupiter encounter.  Potential averages +6 V in the             
      solar wind and sheath, and substantially higher in the                 
      magnetosphere.  The count rate arrays are corrected for                
      spacecraft potential and converted to phase-space density              
      arrays.                                                                
                                                                             
      Plasma moments are then calculated by numerical integration of         
      the velocity weighted ion distributions.  A total integration          
      is performed from the spacecraft potential (corresponding to           
      zero energy solar wind electrons) to the instrumental energy           
      limit.  Since the first few eV above the spacecraft potential          
      are contaminated with photoelectrons on non-radial                     
      trajectories, it is necessary to use a biMaxwellian fit to the         
      lowest energy points to fill in this part of the distribution.         
                                                                             
      The integrations produce density, temperature components,              
      velocity, and heat flux.  At this time, densities, scalar              
      temperatures, and 3-d velocity vectors (for 3-d measurements

      Data Coverage and Quality                                              
      =========================                                              
      In the magnetosphere, a very simple scheme was used for                
      background rejection. The lowest count rate for a given                
      spectrum was subtracted from all pixels in that spectrum.              
      Thus any changes in background during the course of a 2-               
      minute spectra accumulation time are not accounted for.                
      While the resulting plasma densities were corroborated by              
      comparison with the plasma frequency-based densities from the          
      URAP experiment (see magnetosphere paper cited above), the             
      possibility exists that some roll-modulated background exists          
      and distorts the plasma velocities.  At the time of this               
      submission, the velocities provided are the best values                
      available. However, the SWOOPS team is actively pursuing a             
      roll-modulated background rejection scheme, and the data will          
      be updated as appropriate.  The user should be cautious in             
      interpreting the electron velocities.                                  
                                                                             
      During the intervals indicated as open field regions in the            
      listing above, there are significant uncertainties in all              
      plasma parameters. This is due to uncertainties in the                 
      spacecraft potential.  While it is clear that the densities            
      are relatively high and the temperatures are low in these              
      regions, small errors in spacecraft potential can create               
      large errors in all derived plasma parameters.  These values           
      will be updated as the SWOOPS team research into the open              
      field regions continues.                                               
                                                                             
      The spacecraft ephemeris was provided by the Ulysses project           
      at high resolution during the encounter proper.  Far from the          
      planet (i.e. the beginning and ending of the SWOOPS data               
      file), the ephemeris resolution was coarser, and you will see          
      large steps in spacecraft position in the SWOOPS data file.            
      Higher-resolution position information may be available                
      through the PDS."
