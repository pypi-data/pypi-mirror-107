This data set contains sixteen sector rate data for the                      
energetic particle detector obtained from the LEMMS telescope during         
the time of significant activity during the Venus encounter.  (5:45 -        
5:50 and 6:12 - 6:27) Each record contains a single sector's data for        
each of 17 LEMMS channels.  (The CMS telescope was not powered up            
during the Venus encounter.)  Also included are pitch and phase angles       
of the particles counted by the detectors.  The angles are determined        
in a coordinate system defined by the magnetic field (magnetic field         
data provided by Steve Joy) and the position of Venus (calculated with       
SPICE kernel data).  The z-axis of the coordinate system points along        
the magnetic field.  The x-axis is chosen so Venus lies in the xz            
plane.  The pitch angle is the angle between the sector look direction       
and the z-axis.  The phase angle is the angle between x-axis and the         
projection of the x-axis on the xy plane.  All of the data was taken         
with the telescope perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis (motor          
step position = 4).  The rates reported are in units of counts/sec.          
Pitch and phase angles are recorded in radians."
