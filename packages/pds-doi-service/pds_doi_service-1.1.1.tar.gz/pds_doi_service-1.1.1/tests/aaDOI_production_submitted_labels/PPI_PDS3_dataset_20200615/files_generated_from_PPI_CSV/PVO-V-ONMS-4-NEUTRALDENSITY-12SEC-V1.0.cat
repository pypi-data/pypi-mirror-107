     The instrument was designed to determine the composition                
     of the neutral thermosphere/exosphere of Venus. The term                
     composition includes both the type of neutral gases present             
     and their quantitative amount. The measurements begin at the            
     orbit's periapsis altitude and extend to a limiting altitude            
     at which the ambient signal becomes comparable to the gas               
     background and/or detector measurement threshold.  The neutral          
     composition includes helium, atomic nitrogen, atomic oxygen,            
     molecular nitrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The

   The data are from the nonretarding potential mode of the                  
instrument.  Data from the retarding mode are consistent with                
those obtained from the nonretarding mode and have not been                  
included.  The data set does not include the factor of 1.6

other data sets as discussed by Hedin et al. (1983).  Two                    
data sets are provided: high resolution (HIRES), every point,                
composition; and low resolution (LORES), 12 second sampled,                  
composition.  The LORES data set represents the best                         
estimated composition data and is derived from the HIRES data

   This data is a representative sample, approximately once per              
12 seconds, of the high resolution data. It is constructed at                
designated times which have been supplied by the Project.  Data              
with errors greater that 30% are not included nor are data with              
angles of attack greater than 40 degrees. An absolute altitude               
cutoff of 250 km was used for all species except for He for                  
which 350 km was used.                                                       
                                                                             
   Each representative data point is constructed using an                    
exponentially weighted average of the data over a 24 second                  
interval centered at the sample point time.  Corrections to                  
the number densities of CO2 and O for surface reactions                      
were made at this time based on empirical model results. A                   
minimum of 3 data points per species and all data available                  
for corrections are required to be present in order for a                    
sample point to be output.  The total number density and                     
total mass density are computed if all major species (CO2,                   
CO, N2, and O) are present.  The data spacing is nominally 12                
seconds except for the -12, 0, 12 time tags. Although time                   
tags from -1800 to 1800 seconds are generated, only those data               
records for which at least one species has a valid value for                 
that time tag are output.                                                    
                                                                             
   No spacecraft positional parameters have been included                    
in the data sets.  These can be obtained from the SEDR data

   Several criteria were invoked when inserting data for a given             
orbit: orbit and attitude parameters must exist (project supplied);          
the spacecraft format and bit rate must be appropriate for                   
acquisition of data by the ONMS; and the command sequence for the            
instrument must be appropriate for useful determination of                   
atmospheric composition. Cases where useful composition cannot be            
determined include special test modes (e.g., retarding potential             
sweeps, filament off) and 1/8 unit amu sweep modes.  In addition,            
composition for the LORES data set cannot be easily determined for           
unit amu sweep mode.  The ONMS was not operational for every orbit           
nor is every orbit complete due to data gaps introduced by use of            
telemetry formats for which the ONMS has no instrument output.               
                                                                             
  Useful composition data are gathered from the lowest periapsis             
altitude to a maximum altitude generally around 250 km (about 300            
km for He).  The actual maximum altitude depends on the accumulated          
surface gas buildup acquired from previous orbits which creates a            
gas background.  The gas background was estimated from high altitude         
averages of the data and for all species, except helium, an inbound          
signal/background ratio of 2 and an outbound signal/background ratio         
of 4 were used as cutoff values.  In some cases superthermal ions            
(e.g., Kasprzak et al.,1982) were observed at low altitudes (e.g.,           
below 300 km for orbit 219) and these were removed when visually             
detected.  Some problems have been observed in the high altitude             
data very near cutoff, particularly for outbound N2. Several data            
points were never removed and appear higher than the expected                
extrapolation of the data to that time.                                      
                                                                             
   Residual spin modulation which had not been completely removed            
is evident in the processed data. The source of the spin residuals           
are the gas/surface adsorption/desorption effects which were not             
removed from the data and a noncosine behavior for the response of           
the ion source density with angle of attack.  Another feature                
observed occasionally at large angles of attack (&#10095;40 degrees) is a           
reduction of the data when compared to data at lower angles of               
attack. This has been determined to be due to antenna shadowing;             
that is, the ONMS geometric view cone 'sees' the spacecraft antenna          
at extreme angles of attack. Occasionally near minimum angle of              
attack (&#10094;10 degrees), enhanced data points are observed for m/e=4            
(He channel) which are apparently high energy ions/neutrals                  
traveling along the tube axis and being detected.  The more extreme          
points in either of these two cases have been mass flagged.                  
                                                                             
   The data time spacing depends on the spacecraft bit rate and              
format, and the particular instrument commands executed.  Usually            
programmed mass format was used but occasionally unit amu and 1/8            
amu sweeps were implemented.  Several orbits switched from low               
electron energy to high electron energy and as a result there may            
be a discontinuity at the transition point.  The 1/8 amu sweep data          
have not been included.                                                      
                                                                             
   Atomic nitrogen was measured in programmed mass mode only                 
after orbit 190.                                                             
                                                                             
   Orbits 1-19 generally do not have reliable relative composition           
due to the fact that gas-surface processes in the ion source had not         
stabilized. This affects all surface reactive species except He.             
                                                                             
   Isolated (one or two points per several spin cycles) high                 
resolution data points are occasionally observed and they should be          
regarded as erroneous points which are more likely wrong than right.         
                                                                             
   The error associated with the points is more an indication of data        
quality than of absolute uncertainty.  It contains the statistical           
error of the data determined for the principle m/e used for the species      
from the detector signal plus the errors coming from any other species       
used to correct the data. It also contains a contribution which is           
proportional to the background/signal ratio.  The total relative error       
is at least an additional 5-10% above this value."
