       The DSP-R digitally samples the received spacecraft signal with 8-bit 
       or 12-bit resolution and creates records of varying lengths, depending
       on the sample rate and resolution. Each record is composed of (1)     
       a header containing information on system configuration, time-tagged  
       receiver local oscillator values, etc., and (2) a block of digital    
       data from the four A-D converters.

       The sampled data are later than the reported time tag by two intervals
       of the sample rate of a single A-D converter. This means that in each
