   =================                                                          
     The data set consists of calibrated observations.  The MAG measures      
     the vector magnetic field.                                               
                                                                              
     There are three principal coordinate systems used to represent the data  
     in this archive - the payload (pl) coordinate system, the Sun-state (ss) 
     coordinate system, and the planetocentric (pc) coordinate system.        
     Cartesian representations are used for all four coordinate systems. The  
     pc and ss coordinate systems are specified relative to a 'target body'   
     which may be any solar system object.  Primarily the 'target body' is    
     Jupiter.  In what follows we will reference Jupiter as the target body,  
     but, for example, if observations near a satellite (such as Io) are      
     desired in Io-centric coordinates, the satellite Io may be specified as  
     the target body.                                                         
                                                                              
     The ss coordinate system is defined using the instantaneous Jupiter-Sun  
     vector as the primary reference vector (x direction).  The X-axis lies   
     along this vector and is taken to be positive toward the Sun.  The       
     Jupiter orbital velocity vector is the second vector used to define      
     the coordinate system; the y axis lies in the plane determined by the    
     Jupiter-Sun vector and the velocity vector and is orthogonal to the x    
     axis (very nearly the negative of the velocity vector). The vector       
     cross product of x and y yields a vector z parallel to the northward     
     (upward) normal of the orbit plane of Jupiter. This system is sometimes  
     called a sun-state (ss) coordinate system since its principal vectors    
     are the Sun vector and the Jupiter state vector.                         
                                                                              
     The planetocentric (pc) coordinate system is body-fixed and rotates      
     with the body as it spins on its axis. The body rotation axis is the     
     primary vector used to define this coordinate system. Z is taken to      
     lie along the rotation axis and be positive in the direction of          
     positive angular momentum. The X-axis is defined to lie in the           
     equatorial plane of the body, perpendicular to Z, and in the direction   
     of the prime meridian as defined by the IAU. The Y axis completes the    
     right-handed set.                                                        
                                                                              
     Data in the vicinity of the moons of Jupiter (Io, Europa, Ganymede,      
     Callisto) may be provided in separate files in moon centered coordinate  
     systems, if it turns out that the mission plan affords an opportunity    
     to acquire data in the immediate vicinity of any of these bodies The     
     planetocentric and SS data follows the definitions above with the        
     reference body being the moon or target specified via option in the      
     command line All of the archived data files are simple and readable      
     ASCII files with attached documentation in a header that precedes the    
     columns of data. Files using a coordinate system centered on a target    
     body other than Jupiter are identified via the target body listed on     
     the command line which appears in the header along with an audit trail   
     of supplementary engineering (kernel) files.                             
                                                                              
     The output from the processing program is in Standard Time Series (STS)  
     format. The Object Description Language (odl) header is included in the  
     STS file.  There will also be a detached PDS label file describing the   
     contents of the STS file.                                                
                                                                              
     Each data file contains the observations collected on a given UTC day.

     The FGM powers up in operational mode and returns telemetry              
     immediately every clock tic (2 seconds). The FGM may be operated         
     in autoranging mode, or manual range commands may be sent to fix         
     the instrument in any of its dynamic ranges. Likewise any telemetry      
     mode may be selected, depending on telemetry resource allocation. In     
     addition, packets of engineering telemetry (in addition to science       
     telemetry packets) are telemetered at a variable rate, from one per      
     2 seconds to one per 512 seconds, per commanded state.                   
                                                                              
   Calibration Overview                                                       
   ====================                                                       
     The FGMs were calibrated in the Planetary Magnetospheres Laboratory      
     and the GSFC Mario H. Acuna (MHA) Magnetic Test Facility (MTF), a        
     remote facility located near the GSFC campus. These facilities are       
     sufficient to calibrate the FGMs to 100 parts per million (ppm)          
     absolute vector accuracy. An independent measurement of the magnetic     
     field strength in the 0.25, 1, and 4 Gauss ranges was provided by        
     Overhausen Proton Precession magnetometers placed near the FGM. Scale    
     factor calibration is extended to 16 Gauss using a specialized high      
     field coil and measurement techniques (see JUNO Magnetic Field           
     Investigation instrument paper: (Connerney et al., Space Science         
     Reviews, 2017, doi: 10.1007/s11214-017-0334-z)). A nuclear magnetic      
     resonance magnetometer (Virginia Scientific Instruments) provided the    
     absolute field strength measurements in the 16 Gauss range when it was   
     working.                                                                 
                                                                              
     Two independent methods are used to calibrate the magnetometers. The     
     vector fluxgates are calibrated in the 22' facility using a method       
     ('MAGSAT method') developed by Mario Acuna and others. This technique    
     uses precise 90 degree rotations of the sensing element and a sequence   
     of applied fields to simultaneously determine the magnetometer           
     instrument model response parameters (the 'A matrix') as well as a       
     similar set of parameters (the 'B matrix') that describe the facility    
     coil orthogonality [instrument paper reference]. The second calibration  
     method (called the 'thin shell' and 'thick shell') uses a large set of   
     rotations in a known field (magnitude) to obtain the same instrument     
     parameters, subject to an arbitrary rotation [Merayo 2000 & 2001]. In    
     the 'thin shell' method, the sensor is articulated through all           
     orientations in a fixed, or known field magnitude. This can be done in   
     a facility like the GSFC 22 foot coil system, wherein any fixed field    
     up to about 1.2 Gauss may be utilized, or it may be done in the Earth's  
     field using the ambient field in a gradient-free region and a system     
     to compensate for variations in the ambient field (normally corrected    
     via a secondary reference magnetometer coupled with a Proton Precession  
     total field instrument). Application of this method in a coil facility   
     (with closed loop control for ambient field variations) allows for the   
     'thin shell' to be performed at many field magnitudes ('thick shell').   
                                                                              
     The MAGSAT calibration method provides the instrument calibration        
     parameters referenced to the optical cube mounted on the sensor          
     (or MOB) which defines the instrument coordinate system. These           
     parameters include the instrument scale factors, 3 by 3 instrument       
     response matrix (or 'A' matrix), and zero offsets for each instrument    
     dynamic range. The 'thin shell' method provides the same parameters,     
     but since the method conveys no attitude information, only the           
     symmetric part of the instrument response matrix is determined via       
     'thin shell'. Nevertheless, it provides a useful independent verification
     of the MAGSAT calibration.                                               
                                                                              
     Inflight calibration activities are designed to monitor instrument       
     parameters, primarily zero offsets, and to monitor the relative          
     alignment of the magnetic field sensor platforms (the MOBs) and the      
     spacecraft attitude reference (Stellar Reference Units, or SRUs).        
     Spacecraft generated magnetic fields will be monitored using the dual    
     magnetometer technique and a series of magnetic compatibility tests      
     designed to identify the source of any magnetic signals (if any)         
     associated with spacecraft payloads. Since Juno is a spinning            
     spacecraft, spinning at 1 or 2 rpm nominally, any field fixed in the     
     frame of reference of the spacecraft (e.g., fixed spacecraft-generated   
     magnetic fields, sensor offsets, etc.) is easily identified. In practice 
     we apply an algorithm developed independently by several groups (Acuna,  
     Reviews of Scientific Instruments, 2002) to estimate bias offsets using  
     differences in the measured field. This method handily corrects for      
     biases in the spacecraft x and y axes, but since the spacecraft spins    
     about the z axis, biases in z must be estimated using different methods. 
     One technique utilizes the Alfvenic nature of fluctuations in the solar  
     wind, that is, the magnitude preserving nature of variations in the      
     field. Of course, not all fluctuations are Alfvenic (preserving          
     magnitude) so some care is taken in application of this method to select 
     appropriate events.

     Data products contain the observations collected on a given              
     UTC day.  Each coordinate system in a separate file.                     
                                                                              
     Through 2017 DOY 174, magnetometer observations in weak field            
     environments (sensor range 0, +/- 1600 nT nominal dynamic range) are     
     sourced from the outboard sensor.  Subsequent to 2017 DOY 174,           
     magnetometer observations in weak field environments (sensor range 0,    
     +/- 1600 nT nominal dynamic range) are sourced from the inboard sensor   
     to alleviate minor sporatic interference appearing in the z axis of the  
     outboard sensor.  This substitution is noted in the STS header that      
     identifies the content of each record.  The STS header should be         
     consulted for file content each time a file is read, in the event that   
     file content changes (this was the design purpose of the STS header).    
     We anticipate further file format changes (in upper dynamic ranges) as   
     additional corrections are introduced."

     The FGM data set was reviewed internally by the MAG team prior to        
     release to the PDS. PDS also performed an external review of the MAG     
     data.

   ===========                                                                
     The Juno magnetic field investigation was designed to measure fields     
     to 16 Gauss per axis over 6 dynamic ranges of the instrument, the most   
     sensitive of which is +/- 1600 nT with a quantization step size of       
     0.05 nT (16 bit A/D). Moreover, the spacecraft magnetic requirement was  
     not to exceed 2 nT static and 0.5 nT variable spacecraft-generated       
     magnetic field. In very weak field environments, such as encountered in  
     outer cruise, accuracy may be expected to be limited by sensor offset    
     and spacecraft magnetic field variations. The combined (static)          
     spacecraft-generated magnetic field and sensor offset may be             
     continuously monitored in flight in the spacecraft x and y axis, since   
     the spacecraft spins (nominally at 1 or 2 RPM) about an axis closely     
     aligned with the spacecraft payload z axis. However, offsets in the z    
     axis need be estimated using the Alfvenic properties in the solar wind   
     (Connerney et al., Space Science Reviews, 2017,                          
     doi: 10.1007/s11214-017-0334-z). Statistical in nature, estimates of z   
     axis zeros are not continuously available and are less accurate than the 
     x and y zeros. Also, variations in spacecraft field over a time span     
     comparable to a spin period will also lead to larger errors."
