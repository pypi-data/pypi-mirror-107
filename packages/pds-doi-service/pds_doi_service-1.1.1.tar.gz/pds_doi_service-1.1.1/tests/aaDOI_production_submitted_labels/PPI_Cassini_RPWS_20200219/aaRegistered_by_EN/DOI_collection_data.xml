        <!-- Collection definition:
                a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects. 
                A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
                retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
                the overall group of items.

				This collection provides electron number density values derived from features observed in plasma wave data obtained by the Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instruments, along with observed or derived characteristic frequencies, and useful positional parameters for the spacecraft and related bodies.  When present, frequency values of narrowband emissions at the upper hybrid resonance were digitized and combined with measured or model magnetic field to derive electron number density.  At other times, features such as the upper cutoff in auroral hiss or electron plasma oscillations were used to determine the plasma frequency and electron density.
