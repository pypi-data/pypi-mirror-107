        <!-- Collection definition:
                a Collection product may refer to an aggregation of resources and research objects. 
                A Collection probably has items in it which have or will receive their own DOIs and thus be
                retrievable independently. Therefore the Collection record is a high-level description of
                the overall group of items.
