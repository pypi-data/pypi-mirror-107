    Hill estimator for the tail index in the peaks over threshold approach. [1]

    Contains a plotting routine for the Hill estimator against the number of order statistics.
    Confidence intervals are based on the asymptotic behaviour of the variance of the estimate. [2]
    Bias is not taken into account.
