        pyLFI is a Python toolbox for likelihood-free inference (LFI) for estimating the posterior distributions of model parameters.
        
        This repository provides a Python library for kernel density estimation. In comparison to other Python implementations of kernel density estimation, key features of this library include:
        
        1. Support for weighted samples
        2. A variety of kernels, including a smooth, compact kernel.
        
        **Initial development is in progress, and there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.**
