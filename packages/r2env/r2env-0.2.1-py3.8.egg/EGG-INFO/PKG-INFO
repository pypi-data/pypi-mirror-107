        This repository contains the tool available via pip to install
        and manage multiple versions of radare2 and its plugins.
        
        r2-tools doesn't conflict with r2pm in the sense that it's not
        going to support all the packages and plugins and it's
        
        r2env supports source and binary packages.
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        * r2env should be self contained
        
        Some tools may be used if installed in the system, making some
        packages available, but we may try to use python-version if
        possible, so it don't depend on system packages.

        How to install
        --------------
        
        r2env is available via PIP. (`pip install r2env`)
        
        To build + install from source just run: `make`
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First of all you may want to initialize the `.r2env` directory somewhere with `cd .. ; r2env init`.
        
        Listing available packages is done via `r2env list`.
        
        Source packages are managed with the `add`, `rm`, `use` and `unused`.
        
        For example: Installing radare2 (assumes @git version)
        
        ```
        cd /tmp
        r2env init
        r2env add radare2
        r2env use radare2@git
        r2env shell r2 -v
        ```
        
        r2pm vs r2env
        -------------
        
        r2env aims to provide a packaging for r2 with support for binary packages and for all major platforms.
        
        r2pm focus on providing more packages, it's written in shellscript, so it doesnt run on windows and requires r2 to work.
        
        Therefor r2env is kind of `nvm` from nodejs or `pyenv` from python. A way to run multiple different versions of r2 in the system.
