# pug_watcher.py
A simple command-line watcher/compiler that transforms Pug to HTML files (and syncs folders!)

# Requirements
- Python 3.6 or above

# Install
You can install it by simply doing `pip install pug_watcher`

## Arguments
By simply writing `pug_watcher` in the console, you will be shown all available commands that it has to offer.

## --config argument
There is a config file you can use to avoid having to use every single argument available in command arguments. Simply create a file called `.pug_watcher.json`. The file accepts the following arguments:
```json
{
  "watch": bool, // If it should watch the paths in question for changes (Default: false)
  "path": str, // The paths to watch/compile like 'source/dir:dest/dir' (Default: src:dist)
  "debug": bool // If the compiler should show what it does (Default: false)
}
```
