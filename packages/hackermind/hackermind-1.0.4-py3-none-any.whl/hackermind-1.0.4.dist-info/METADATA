# Mastermind
It's codebreaker versus codebreaker. Pit yourself against your friends 
and find out who the real <i>Mastermind</i> is! The rules are simple. 
Players take turns trying to crack their secret code using logic and visual 
hints. The first person to prove they're a mastermind wins!

## Getting Started
