Description: # INGRID
        
        Tokamak edge plasma grid generator for magnetic-topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain.
        
        ## Description
        
        INGRID (Interactive Grid) is a Python based tokamak edge plasma grid generator capable of automatic generation of grids for magnetic-topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain. The code generates block-structured grids in three steps:
        
            - Analysis of MHD reconscruction code such as EFIT to identify the embedded topology.
            - Generation of the appropriate Patch map which appropriately models the domain (blocks).
            - Generation of the grid ready for export.
            
        INGRID can be utilized in a GUI mode and noninteractively via Python scripts. Both modes of operation support the use of the YAML formatted parameter file.
