        # Connect 4 CLI
        The classic 4-in-a-line game, also called connect 4, playable from the CLI or shell.
        
        ## Details
        This is a simple implementation of the classic connect 4 game. It can be played directly from the CLI or shell.
        
        ## Installation
        The game is available as a `pip` package. Download it with the following command:
        ```
        pip install connect-4-cli
        ```
        
        Preferably, install in [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).
        In Windows, for example:
        1. Run the following commands from the CLI:
        ```
        py -m venv venv
        ```
        2. Activate the virtual environment with the `activate` script inside the `./venv/Scripts/` folder:
           - Using command window: 
           ```
           call venv/Scripts/activate
           ```
           - Or using `powershell`:
           ```
           ./venv/Scripts/activate.ps1
           ```
        3. `pip` install the package.
        
        ## How to play
        Run the following command (with activated virtual environment if installed there) to start the game:
        ```
        connect-4-cli
        ```
        Play the game using keyboard keys, as prompted in the game.
