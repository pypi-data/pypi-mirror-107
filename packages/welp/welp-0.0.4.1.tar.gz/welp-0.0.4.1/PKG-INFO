        `welp` is a yelp CLI client and business recommender
        
        ## Features
        
        - Utilizes Yelp! Fusion API for business searches
        - Google Geolocation API searching user location based off wifi
        - (Planned) Python Curses menus
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use pip3
        ```
        pip3 install welp
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        You will need a Yelp Fusion API key in order to use this application.
        
        Once you have it, export it to your environment
        ```
        export YELP_API_KEY=<key>
        ```
        
        If you'd like to use Google Geolocation API for automated geolocated, provide the environment with the Google API Key also:
        ```
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<key>
        ```
        
        Both of these keys are basically free for to use individually. The Google API will require a form of payment, but has a free credit program.
