## Usage

**lola is made for linux newbies who can find it difficult to download software**

Now many will tell, Why use lola when we have those software managers?

Well, lola is a Command Line Interface and is used inside the terminal. And as we know, terminal downloads are way more faster than the software managers. While many softwares can be downloaded with a single `sudo apt install`, most common ones need some more commands.

So `lola` is here to make your life way more easier while installing software! This project targets both advanced and beginner users, because who doesn't like speedy and quicky stuff?
