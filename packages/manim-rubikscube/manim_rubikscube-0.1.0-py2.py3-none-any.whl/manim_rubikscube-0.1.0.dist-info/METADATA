This plugin is `available on PyPi. <https://pypi.org/project/manim-rubikscube/>`_
Usage of this plugin assumes that Python and Manim are both correctly installed. Manim is listed as a dependency, but no version is specified.

To see what versions of Manim are confirmed to be compatible with this plugin (to the best of my testing), `see Releases. <https://github.com/WampyCakes/manim-rubikscube/releases>`_ By no means is this exclusive. Most releases of this plugin will work, more or less, on all versions of Manim Community.
