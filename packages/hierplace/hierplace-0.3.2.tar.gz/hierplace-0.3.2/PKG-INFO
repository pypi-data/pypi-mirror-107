Description: XESS Hierarchical Placement Plugin
        ==================================
        
        This PCBNEW plugin arranges the parts into groups that reflect the
        hierarchy in the design.
        
        -  Free software: MIT license
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Creates an arrangement of the parts that reflects their level in the
           design hierarchy.
        -  Will arrange only the parts that have been selected or, if no parts
           are selected, the entire design.
        -  Will not move locked parts.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        On linux, just copy ``HierPlace.py`` to your local ``~/.kicad_plugins``
        directory.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        There are two ways to use this plugin:
        
        1. Press the ``Tools => External Plugins... => HierPlace`` button and
           all the unlocked parts will be arranged.
        
        2. Select a subset of the parts and press the ``HierPlace`` button and
           only the unlocked parts in the selection will be arranged.
        
        Example
        ~~~~~~~
        
        Here is an example of an initial arrangement of parts in PCBNEW. The
        SDRAM BGA and its seven decoupling capacitors are highlighted to show
        how widely separated they are. Other sections of the circuitry are
        similarly scattered.

        The arrangement after running ``HierPlace`` is shown below. Now the
        SDRAM and its decoupling capacitors are closely grouped, as are the
        other sections of the circuitry.
