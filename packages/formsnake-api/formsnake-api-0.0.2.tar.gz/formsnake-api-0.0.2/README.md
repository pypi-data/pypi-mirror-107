Formsnake API
==

A secure, open-source replacement for other form providers. Host your own forms platform, collect responses, and visualize data, all on your own infrastructure.

This repository only covers the back-end of the service. Any custom client can be made to interact with this back-end, but an official one will be developed, as well.

About
--

This project is designed to replace services like Google Forms with an open-source alternative. Privacy is a big issue, and some people would like to store responses to the forms and questionnaires they create somewhere they can trust. Whether it's a comapny collecting private, internal data or a student trying to do a survey for school, people deserve to know where their data is held.

Other platforms like this already exist, but I wanted to make my own as a bit of a challenge to myself. Simply for that reason, this exists.
