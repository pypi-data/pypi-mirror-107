        ## Identity API
        
        The identity API is used to manage identities and authentication in the Iotics Host.
        The API is split in 3 level according to the user needs:
        
        * [High level identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/high_level_api.py): minimal set of features to interact with Iotics Host
        * [Identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/regular_api.py): set of features for basic identities management
        * [Advanced identity API](iotics/lib/identity/api/advanced_api.py): set of features for advanced identities management
        
        ## How to
        
        Two examples are provided to illustrate the usage of the **high level API** and the **regular api**.
        See [Iotics Identity API How To](./how_to/README.md).
