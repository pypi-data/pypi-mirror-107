PiView provides the details of the Raspberry Pi currently being interrogated. System information includes, but is not limited to:

- **CPU**: max load across cores, temperature, clock speed
- **GPU**: temperature
- **HARDWARE**: bluetooth, i2c, spi, camera statuses
- **HOST**: boot time, model, name, revision, serial number, uptime
- **NETWORK**: host name, interface names, ip addresses, mac addresses
- **STORAGE**: total disk capacity, free disk capacity, total RAM and free RAM

Also includes a small utility library with:

- conversion of bytes into Kilobytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes and up
- create list with a quartet of integer numbers representing the IPv4 Address
