# HeatPump #

A Python module to configure heat-pump systems for sustainable heating.  We intend to include heat pumps, air
and ground sources, solar collectors, solar panels and PV-T, heating and hot tap-water systems, and more.  The
code is being developed by the research group Balanced Energy Systems of the HAN University of Applied
Sciences in Arnhem, the Netherlands and the research group of Sustainable Energy Supply of Saxion University
of Applied Sciences in Deventer, the Netherlands.
