If a then vinka hands controls entirely over to the basic editor until receiving control back
If r likewise to the reviewer.
The previewer is presented with a list of the editor's shortcuts and asked to honor them.
The editor is responsible for initializing the card's files (using an id and timestamp provided by vinka)

reload conditions
- after add

- on load

vinka will show a list of decks but it only handles very basic things like changes between cards.

vinka is designed to be entirely modular so that any part can be edited or replaced. A CARD is the source of authority. It decides what editor edits it, what reviewer reviews it, and what scheduler schedules it. The browser can be changed at will.

The browser may save quite a bit of extra data to try to speed up and facilitate its operations, but the cards ultimately determine this. They are self contained: they specify their servants, their history, and their due date. This is true even when multiple cards correspond to a single note e.g. image occlusion. The cards specify their parent note which is stil conceived of as subservient.
