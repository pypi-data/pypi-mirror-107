Description: DjHTML
        ======
        
        ***A pure-Python Django template indenter without dependencies.***
        
        DjHTML is a Django template indenter that works with mixed
        HTML/CSS/Javascript templates. It works similar to other
        code-formatting tools such as [Black](https://github.com/psf/black).
        The goal is to correctly indent already well-structured templates but
        not to fix broken ones.
        
        For example, DjHTML converts the following badly indented template:
        
            <!doctype html>
            <html>
                <body>
                    {% block content %}
                    Hello, world!
                    {% endblock %}
                    <script>
                        $(function() {
                        console.log('Hi mom!');
                        });
                    </script>
                </body>
            </html>
        
        To the following:
        
            <!doctype html>
            <html>
                <body>
                    {% block content %}
                        Hello, world!
                    {% endblock %}
                    <script>
                        $(function() {
                            console.log('Hi mom!');
                        });
                    </script>
                </body>
            </html>
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install DjHTML with the following command:
        
            $ pip install djhtml
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        After installation you can indent Django templates using the `djhtml`
        command. The default is to write the indented output to standard out.
        To modify the source file in-place, use the `-i` / `--in-place`
        option:
        
            $ djhtml -i template.html
            Successfully reformatted template.html
        
        The other available options are:
        
        - `-h` / `--help`: show overview of available options
        - `-q` / `--quiet`: don't print any output
        - `-t` / `--tabwidth`: set tabwidth (default is 4)
        - `-o` / `--output-file`: write output to specified file
        
        
        Pre-commit configuration
        ------------------------
        
        You can use DjHTML as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to
        automatically indent your Django templates upon each commit.
        
        First, install pre-commit:
        
            $ pip install pre-commit
            $ pre-commit install
        
        Then, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
        
            repos:
            - repo: https://github.com/rtts/djhtml
              rev: main
              hooks:
              - id: djhtml
        
        Finally, run the following command:
        
            $ pre-commit autoupdate
        
        Now when you run `git commit` you will see something like the
        following output:
        
            $ git commit
        
            djhtml...................................................................Failed
            - hook id: djhtml
            - files were modified by this hook
        
            Successfully reformatted template.html
        
        To inspect the changes that were made, use `git diff`. If you are
        happy with the changes, you can commit them normally. If you are not
        happy, please do the following:
        
        1. Run `SKIP=djhtml git commit` to commit anyway, skipping the
           `djhtml` hook.
        
        2. Consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml/issues)
           with relevant part of the input file that was incorrectly
           formatted, and an example of how it should have been formatted.
        
        Your feedback for improving DjHTML is very welcome!
