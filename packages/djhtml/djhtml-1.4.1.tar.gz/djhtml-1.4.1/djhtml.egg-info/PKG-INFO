Description: # DjHTML
        
        ***A pure-Python Django/Jinja2 template indenter without dependencies.***
        
        DjHTML is a fully automatic template indenter that works with mixed
        HTML/CSS/Javascript templates that contain
        [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/)
        or [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/templates/) template
        tags. It works similar to other code-formatting tools such as
        [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) and interoperates nicely with
        [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).
        
        DjHTML is an _indenter_ and not a _formatter_: it will only add/remove
        whitespace at the beginning of lines. It will not insert newlines or
        other characters. The goal is to correctly indent already
        well-structured templates, not to fix broken ones.
        
        For example, consider the following incorrectly indented template:
        
        ```jinja
        <!doctype html>
        <html>
            <body>
                {% block content %}
                Hello, world!
                {% endblock %}
                <script>
                    $(function() {
                    console.log('Hi mom!');
                    });
                </script>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        This is what it will look like after processing by DjHTML:
        
        ```jinja
        <!doctype html>
        <html>
            <body>
                {% block content %}
                    Hello, world!
                {% endblock %}
                <script>
                    $(function() {
                        console.log('Hi mom!');
                    });
                </script>
            </body>
        </html>
        ```
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install DjHTML with the following command:
        
            $ pip install djhtml
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installation you can indent templates using the `djhtml`
        command. The default is to write the indented output to standard out.
        To modify the source file in-place, use the `-i` / `--in-place`
        option:
        
            $ djhtml -i template.html
            reindented template.html
            All done! \o/
            1 template reindented.
        
        The other available options are:
        
        - `-h` / `--help`: show overview of available options
        - `-q` / `--quiet`: don't print any output
        - `-t` / `--tabwidth`: set tabwidth (default is 4)
        - `-o` / `--output-file`: write output to specified file
        
        The installer also installs the `djtxt`, `djcss`, and `djjs` commands
        for indenting plain text, CSS and Javascript source files,
        respectively.
        
        ## pre-commit configuration
        
        You can use DjHTML as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook to
        automatically indent your templates upon each commit.
        
        First, install pre-commit:
        
            $ pip install pre-commit
            $ pre-commit install
        
        Then, add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
        
        ```yml
        repos:
        - repo: https://github.com/rtts/djhtml
          rev: main
          hooks:
            - id: djhtml
        ```
        
        Finally, run the following command:
        
            $ pre-commit autoupdate
        
        Now when you run `git commit` you will see something like the
        following output:
        
            $ git commit
        
            djhtml...................................................................Failed
            - hook id: djhtml
            - files were modified by this hook
        
            reindented template.html
            All done! \o/
            1 template reindented.
        
        To inspect the changes that were made, use `git diff`. If you are
        happy with the changes, you can commit them normally. If you are not
        happy, please do the following:
        
        1. Run `SKIP=djhtml git commit` to commit anyway, skipping the
           `djhtml` hook.
        
        2. Consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml/issues)
           with the relevant part of the input file that was incorrectly
           formatted, and an example of how it should have been formatted.
        
        Your feedback for improving DjHTML is very welcome!
