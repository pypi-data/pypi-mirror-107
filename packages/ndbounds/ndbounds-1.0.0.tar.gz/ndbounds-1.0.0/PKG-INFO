Description: # ndbounds
        
        Toolbox for handling n-dimensional bounds.
        
        ## n-Dimensional Bounds
        
        This is a format to combine methods for working with boundaries in
        * 1D (e.g. onset & end of waveforms),
        * 2D (e.g. bounding boxes in an image) or
        * any higher nD case.
        
        The basic idea of the format is, to store the bounds in an array organized as follows:
        
            [[start dim 1, end dim 1],
             [start dim 2, end dim 2],
             ...,
             [start dim n, end dim n]]
