This is a Indicators of economic effect of agricultural production.
The economic effect index of agricultural production is a scale 
used to measure and reflect the economic effect of agricultural 
production plans, technical measures, and agricultural investment 
projects. 
It is a specific form of the content of the economic 
effect of agricultural production through numerical values. 
Because agriculture is affected by many factors, in order to 
comprehensively measure the economic effects of agricultural 
production, it is necessary to set a series of indicators to 
reflect the size of the economic effects from a certain aspect 
and a certain range.
It contains all the formulas you will use.
