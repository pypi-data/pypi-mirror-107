# elastic-agent-setup

A python package to install and enroll an Elastic Agent on multiple host operating systems.

## Getting Started

In order to use this package you must configure general settings for your environment. Here is an example of the configuration options:

```python
from elastic_agent_setup import ElasticAgent

agent = ElasticAgent()
agent.configure(
    username='admin', 
    password='some_password'
    elasticsearch='https://elasticsearch:9200',
    kibana='https://kibana:5601',
    certificate_authority=None,
    verify_ssl=True
)
```

Once you have configured the `elastic-agent-setup` package you can either `install` or `enroll` your elastic-agent.

> Please see Elatics documentation on the differences between enrolling and installing an agent.

Here is an example of installing an Elastic Agent:

```python
from elastic_agent_setup import ElasticAgent

agent = ElasticAgent()
agent.configure(
    username='admin', 
    password='some_password'
    elasticsearch='https://elasticsearch:9200',
    kibana='https://kibana:5601',
    certificate_authority=None,
    verify_ssl=True
)

response = agent.install(
    version='7.12.1,
    preflight_check=True
)

print(response)
```
