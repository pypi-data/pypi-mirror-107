The Stratux Cursor on Target Gateway transforms Stratux aircraft
position information into Cursor on Target (CoT) Position Location Information
(PLI) for display on Situational Awareness (SA) applications such as the
Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK), WinTAK, RaptorX, et al.

Stratux messages are received via the /traffic Websocket.
